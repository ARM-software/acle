# Arm C Language Extensions

This repository contains the source material form which the
specifications for the Arm C Language Extensions (ACLE) is derived.
For the published documents please see the [Arm developer ACLE
page](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/system-architectures/software-standards/acle)

## Contributing

The branch ``main`` is the release branch, whose tip contains the
latest release. Therefore, please submit your PR against the branch
``next-release``.

## Defect reports

Please report defects in or enhancements to the specifications in this folder to
the [issue tracker page on
GitHub](https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/issues).

For reporting defects or enhancements to documents that currenlty are not yet
included in this repo and are thus only hosted on developer.arm.com, please send
an email to arm.acle@arm.com.

## Transitioning the ACLE specifications

This is a work in progress. The document added to the repository will
be referenced in this README file when added.
