# Arm®v8-M Security Extensions - Requirements on Development Tools

## About this document

The [Arm®v8-M Security Extensions - Requirements on Development Tools](cmse.md)
provides information about the requirements on Development Tools in order to
support Armv8-M and Armv8.1-M Security Extensions or the new TT instruction of
Armv8-M.

## About the license

As identified more fully in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (for example, changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.
