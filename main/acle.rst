Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
=================

As identified more fully in the License_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the LICENSE file.

We do not require copyright assignment. The original contributor will

Scope
=====

The Arm C Language Extensions (ACLE) specification specifies source
language extensions and implementation choices that C/C++ compilers can
implement in order to allow programmers to better exploit the Arm
architecture.

The extensions include:

 * Predefined macros that provide information about the functionality of
   the target architecture.

 * Intrinsic functions.

 * Attributes that can be applied to functions, data and other entities.

This specification does not standardize command-line options,
diagnostics or other external behavior of compilers.

The intended users of this specification are:

 * Application programmers wishing to adapt or hand-optimize
   applications and libraries for Arm targets.

 * System programmers needing low-level access to Arm targets beyond
   what C/C++ provides for.

 * Compiler implementors, who will implement this specification.

 * Implementors of IDEs, static analysis and other similar tools who wish to
   deal with the C/C++ source language extensions when encountered in
   source code.

ACLE is not a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), and does not specify a
library component but it may make it easier to write a HAL or other
low-level library in C rather than assembler.

Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE)
================================

ACLE support for SVE is defined in the Arm C Language Extensions for SVE
document [SVE-ACLE]_ available on the Arm Developer Website.

Introduction
############

The Arm architecture includes features that go beyond the set of operations
available to C/C++ programmers. The intention of the Arm C Language
Extensions (ACLE) is to allow the creation of applications and middleware
code that is portable across compilers, and across Arm architecture
variants, while exploiting the advanced features of the Arm architecture.

The design principles for ACLE can be summarized as:

 * Be implementable in (or as an addition to) current C/C++
   implementations.

 * Build on and standardize existing practice where possible.

ACLE incorporates some language extensions introduced in the GCC C
compiler. Current GCC documentation [GCC]_ can be found at
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc.
Formally it should be assumed that ACLE refers to the documentation for
GCC 4.5.1: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.1/gcc/.

Some of the ACLE extensions are not specific to the Arm architecture but
have proven to be of particular benefit in low-level and systems
programming; examples include features for controlling the alignment and
packing of data, and some common operations such as word rotation and
reversal. As and when features become available in international
standards (and implementations), Arm recommends that you use these in
preference to ACLE. When implementations are widely available, any
ACLE-specific features can be expected to be deprecated.


Portable binary objects
=======================

In AArch32, the *ABI for the Arm Architecture* defines a set of build
attributes [BA]_. These attributes are intended to facilitate generating
cross-platform portable binary object files by providing a mechanism to
determine the compatibility of object files. In AArch64, the ABI does
not define a standard set of build attributes and takes the approach
that binaries are, in general, not portable across platforms. References
to build attributes in this document should be interpreted as applying
only to AArch32.

C language extensions
#####################

Data types
==========

This section overlaps with the specification of the Arm Procedure Call
Standard, particularly [AAPCS]_ (4.1). ACLE extends some of the guarantees
of C, allowing assumptions to be made in source code beyond those
permitted by Standard C.

 * Plain char is unsigned, as specified in the ABI [AAPCS]_ and
   [AAPCS64]_ (7.1.1).

 * When pointers are 32 bits, the long type is 32 bits (ILP32 model).

 * When pointers are 64 bits, the long type may be either 64 bits (LP64
   model) or 32 bits (LLP64 model).

ACLE extends C by providing some types not present in Standard C and
defining how they are dealt with by the AAPCS.

 * Vector types for use with the Advanced SIMD intrinsics (see
   ssec-vectypes_).

 * The ``__fp16`` type for 16-bit floating-point values (see
   ssec-fp16-type_).

 * The ``__bf16`` type for 16-bit brain floating-point values (see
   ssec-bf16-type_).

.. _ssec-Imptype:

Implementation-defined type properties
--------------------------------------

ACLE and the Arm ABI allow implementations some freedom in order to
conform to long-standing conventions in various environments. It is
suggested that implementations set suitable defaults for their
environment but allow the default to be overridden.

The signedness of a plain int bit-field is implementation-defined.

Whether the underlying type of an enumeration is minimal or at least
32-bit, is implementation-defined. The predefined macro
``__ARM_SIZEOF_MINIMAL_ENUM`` should be defined as 1 or 4 according to
the size of a minimal enumeration type such as ``enum { X=0 }``. An
implementation that conforms to the Arm ABI must reflect its choice in
the ``Tag_ABI_enum_size build`` attribute.

``wchar_t`` may be 2 or 4 bytes. The predefined macro
``__ARM_SIZEOF_WCHAR_T`` should be defined as the same number. An
implementation that conforms to the Arm ABI must reflect its choice in
the ``Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t`` build attribute.

Predefined macros
=================

Several predefined macros are defined. Generally these define features
of the Arm architecture being targeted, or how the C/C++ implementation
uses the architecture. These macros are detailed in
sec-Feature-test-macros_. All ACLE predefined macros start with the
prefix ``__ARM.``

Intrinsics
==========

ACLE standardizes intrinsics to access the Arm |regp| Neon |tradep| architecture
extension. These intrinsics are intended to be compatible with existing
implementations. Before using the Neon intrinsics or data types, the
``<arm_neon.h>`` header must be included. The Neon intrinsics are defined
in sec-NEON-intrinsics_. Note that the Neon intrinsics and data
types are in the user namespace.

ACLE standardizes intrinsics to access the Arm M-profile Vector Extension (MVE).
These intrinsics are intended to be compatible with existing implementations.
Before using the MVE intrinsics or data types, the ``<arm_mve.h>`` header must
be included. The MVE intrinsics are defined in sec-MVE-intrinsics_. Note
that the MVE data types are in the user namespace, the MVE intrinsics can
optionally be left out of the user namespace.

ACLE also standardizes other intrinsics to access Arm instructions which
do not map directly to C operators generally either for optimal
implementation of algorithms, or for accessing specialist system-level
features. Intrinsics are defined further in various following sections.

Before using the non-Neon intrinsics, the ``<arm_acle.h>`` header should be
included.

Whether intrinsics are macros, functions or built-in operators is
unspecified. For example:

 * It is unspecified whether applying #undef to an intrinsic
   removes the name from visibility
 * It is unspecified whether it is possible to take the address
   of an intrinsic

However, each argument must be evaluated at most once. So this
definition is acceptable:

::

  #define __rev(x) __builtin_bswap32(x)

but this is not:

::

  #define __rev(x) ((((x) & 0xff) << 24) | (((x) & 0xff00) << 8) | \
    (((x) & 0xff0000) >> 8) | ((x) >> 24))

.. _sec-Constant-arguments-to-intrinsics:

Constant arguments to intrinsics
--------------------------------

Some intrinsics may require arguments that are constant at compile-time,
to supply data that is encoded into the immediate fields of an
instruction. Typically, these intrinsics require an
integral-constant-expression in a specified range, or sometimes a string
literal. An implementation should produce a diagnostic if the argument
does not meet the requirements.

Header files
============

``<arm_acle.h>`` is provided to make the non-Neon intrinsics available.
These intrinsics are in the C implementation namespace and begin with
double underscores. It is unspecified whether they are available without
the header being included. The ``__ARM_ACLE`` macro should be tested
before including the header:

::

  #ifdef __ARM_ACLE
  #include <arm_acle.h>
  #endif /* __ARM_ACLE */

``<arm_neon.h>`` is provided to define the Neon intrinsics. As these
intrinsics are in the user namespace, an implementation would not
normally define them until the header is included. The ``__ARM_NEON``
macro should be tested before including the header:

::

  #ifdef __ARM_NEON
  #include <arm_neon.h>
  #endif /* __ARM_NEON */

``<arm_mve.h>`` is provided to define the M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE)
intrinsics.  By default these intrinsics occupy both the user namespace and
the ``__arm_`` namespace, defining ``__ARM_MVE_PRESERVE_USER_NAMESPACE`` will
hide the definition of the user namespace variants. The ``__ARM_FEATURE_MVE``
macro should be tested before including the header:

::

  #if (__ARM_FEATURE_MVE & 3) == 3
  #include <arm_mve.h>
  /* MVE integer and floating point intrinsics are now available to use.  */
  #elif __ARM_FEATURE_MVE & 1
  #include <arm_mve.h>
  /* MVE integer intrinsics are now available to use.  */
  #endif

``<arm_fp16.h>`` is provided to define the scalar 16-bit floating point
arithmetic intrinsics. As these intrinsics are in the user namespace,
an implementation would not normally define them until the header is
included. The ``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC`` feature macro
should be tested before including the header:

::

  #ifdef __ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC
  #include <arm_fp16.h>
  #endif /* __ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC */

Including ``<arm_neon.h>`` will also cause ``<arm_fp16.h>`` to be included
if appropriate.

``<arm_bf16.h>`` is provided to define the 16-bit brain floating point
arithmetic intrinsics. As these intrinsics are in the user namespace,
an implementation would not normally define them until the header is
included. The ``__ARM_FEATURE_BF16`` feature macro
should be tested before including the header:

::

  #ifdef __ARM_FEATURE_BF16
  #include <arm_bf16.h>
  #endif /* __ARM_FEATURE_BF16 */

When ``__ARM_BF16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` is defined to ``1`` the only scalar
instructions available are conversion instrinstics between ``bfloat16_t`` and
``float32_t``.  These instructions are:

* `vcvth_bf16_f32` (convert float32_t to bfloat16_t)
* `vcvtah_f32_bf16` (convert bfloat16_t to float32_t)

Including ``<arm_neon.h>`` will also cause ``<arm_bf16.h>`` to be included
if appropriate.

These headers behave as standard library headers; repeated inclusion has
no effect beyond the first include.

It is unspecified whether the ACLE headers include the standard headers
``<assert.h>``, ``<stdint.h>`` or ``<inttypes.h>``. However, the ACLE headers
will not define the standard type names (for example ``uint32_t``) except by
inclusion of the standard headers. Programmers are recommended to include
the standard headers explicitly if the associated types and macros are
needed.

In C++, the following source code fragments are expected to work
correctly:

::

  #include <stdint.h>
  // UINT64_C not defined here since we did not set __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
  ...
  #include <arm_neon.h>

and::

  #include <arm_neon.h>
  ...
  #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
  #include <stdint.h>
  // ... UINT64_C is now defined

Attributes
==========

GCC-style attributes are provided to annotate types, objects and
functions with extra information, such as alignment. These attributes
are defined in sec-Attributes-and-pragmas_.

Implementation strategies
=========================

An implementation may choose to define all the ACLE non-Neon intrinsics
as true compiler intrinsics, i.e. built-in functions. The ``<arm_acle.h>``
header would then have no effect.

Alternatively, ``<arm_acle.h>`` could define the ACLE intrinsics in terms
of already supported features of the implementation, for example compiler
intrinsics with other names, or inline functions using inline assembler.

.. _ssec-fp16-type:

Half-precision floating-point
-----------------------------

ACLE defines the ``__fp16`` type, which can be used for half-precision
(16-bit) floating-point in one of two formats. The binary16 format defined
in [IEEE-FP]_, and referred to as *IEEE* format, and an alternative format,
defined by Arm, which extends the range by removing support for
infinities and NaNs, referred to as *alternative* format. Both formats are
described in [ARMARM]_ (A2.7.4), [ARMARMv8]_ (A1.4.2).

Toolchains are not required to support the alternative format, and use
of the alternative format precludes use of the ISO/IEC TS 18661:3 [CFP15]_
``_Float16`` type and the Armv8.2-A 16-bit floating-point extensions. For
these reasons, Arm deprecates the use of the alternative format for
half precision in ACLE.

The format in use can be selected at runtime but ACLE assumes it
is fixed for the life of a program. If the ``__fp16`` type is available,
one of ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE`` and ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` will
be defined to indicate the format in use. An implementation conforming to
the Arm ABI will set the ``Tag_ABI_FP_16bit_format`` build attribute.

The ``__fp16`` type can be used in two ways; using the intrinsics ACLE
defines when the Armv8.2-A 16-bit floating point extensions are available,
and using the standard C operators. When using standard C operators,
values of ``__fp16`` type promote to (at least) float when used in
arithmetic operations, in the same way that values of char or short types
promote to int. There is no support for arithmetic directly on ``__fp16``
values using standard C operators. ::

  void add(__fp16 a, __fp16 b) {
    a + b; /* a and b are promoted to (at least) float.
              Operation takes place with (at least) 32-bit precision.  */
    vaddh_f16 (a, b); /* a and b are not promoted.
                         Operation takes place with 16-bit precision.  */
  }

Armv8 introduces floating point instructions to convert 64-bit to 16-bit
i.e. from double to ``__fp16.`` They are not available in earlier
architectures, therefore have to rely on emulation libraries or a
sequence of instructions to achieve the conversion. 

Providing emulation libraries for half-precision floating point
conversions when not implemented in hardware is implementation-defined. ::

  double xd;
  __fp16 xs = (float)xd;

rather than: ::

  double xd;
  __fp16 xs = xd;

In some older implementations, ``__fp16`` cannot be used as an argument or
result type, though it can be used as a field in a structure passed as
an argument or result, or passed via a pointer. The predefined macro
``__ARM_FP16_ARGS`` should be defined if ``__fp16`` can be used as an
argument and result. C++ name mangling is Dh as defined in [cxxabi]_,
and is the same for both the IEEE and alternative formats.

In this example, the floating-point addition is done in single (32-bit)
precision:

::

  void add(__fp16 *z, __fp16 const *x, __fp16 const *y, int n) {
     int i;
     for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) z[i] = x[i] + y[i];
   }

Relationship between ``__fp16`` and ISO/IEC TS 18661
----------------------------------------------------
ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 [CFP15]_ is a published extension to [C11]_ which
describes a language binding for the [IEEE-FP]_ standard for floating
point arithmetic. This language binding introduces a mapping to an
unlimited number of interchange and extended floating-point types, on
which binary arithmetic is well defined. These types are of the
form ``_FloatN``, where ``N`` gives size in bits of the type.

One instantiation of the interchange types introduced by [CFP15]_ is
the ``_Float16`` type. ACLE defines the ``__fp16`` type as a storage
and interchange only format, on which arithmetic operations are defined
to first promote to a type with at least the range and precision of
float.

This has implications for the result of operations which would result
in rounding had the operation taken place in a native 16-bit type. As
software may rely on this behaviour for correctness, arithmetic
operations on ``__fp16`` are defined to promote even when the
Armv8.2-A fp16 extension is available.

Arm recommends that portable software is written to use the ``_Float16``
type defined in [CFP15]_.

Type conversion between a value of type ``__fp16`` and a value of type
``_Float16`` leaves the object representation of the converted value unchanged.

When ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE == 1``, this has no effect on the value of
the object. However, as the representation of certain values has a different
meaning when using the Arm alternative format for 16-bit floating point
values [ARMARM]_ (A2.7.4) [ARMARMv8]_ (A1.4.2), when
``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 1`` the type conversion may introduce
or remove infinity or NaN representations.

Arm recommends that software implementations warn on type conversions
between ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` if ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 1``.

In an arithmetic operation where one operand is of ``__fp16`` type and
the other is of ``_Float16 type``, the ``_Float16`` type is first
converted to ``__fp16`` type following the rules above, and then the
operation is completed as if both operands were of ``__fp16`` type.

[CFP15]_ and [C11]_ do not define vector types, however many C
implementations do provide these extensions. Where they exist, type
conversion between a value of type vector of ``__fp16`` and a value of
type vector of ``_Float16`` leaves the object representation of the
converted value unchanged.

ACLE does not define vector of ``_Float16`` types.

.. _ssec-bf16-type:

Half-precision brain floating-point
------------------------------------

ACLE defines the ``__bf16`` type, which can be used for half-precision
(16-bit) brain floating-point in an alternative format,
defined by Arm, which closely resembles the IEEE 754 single-precision floating
point format.

The ``__bf16`` type is only available when the
``__ARM_BF16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` feature macro is defined.
When it is available it can only be used by the ACLE intrinsics
; it cannot be used with standard C operators.
It is expected that arithmetic using standard C operators be used using a
single-precision floating point format and the value be converted to ``__bf16``
when required using ACLE intrinsics.

Armv8.2-A introduces floating point instructions to convert 32-bit to brain
16-bit i.e. from float to ``__bf16.`` They are not available in earlier
architectures, therefore have to rely on emulation libraries or a
sequence of instructions to achieve the conversion.

Providing emulation libraries for half-precision floating point
conversions when not implemented in hardware is implementation-defined.

Architecture and CPU names
##########################

Introduction
============

The intention of this section is to standardize architecture names, for example
for use in compiler command lines. Toolchains should accept these names
case-insensitively where possible, or use all lowercase where not
possible. Tools may apply local conventions such as using hyphens
instead of underscores.

(Note: processor names, including from the Arm Cortex |reg| processor family,
are used as illustrative examples. This specification is applicable to any
processors implementing the Arm architecture.)

Architecture names
==================

CPU architecture
----------------

The recommended CPU architecture names are as specified under
``Tag_CPU_arch`` in [BA]_. For details of how to use predefined macros to
test architecture in source code, see ssec-ATisa_.

   +----------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------------+

Note that there is some architectural variation that is not visible
through ACLE; either because it is only relevant at the system level
(for example the Large Physical Address Extension) or because it would be
handled by the compiler (for example hardware divide might or might not be
present in the Armv7-A architecture).

FPU architecture

For details of how to test FPU features in source code, see
ssec-HWFPSIMD_. In particular, for testing which precisions are
supported in hardware, see `_ssec-HWFP`.

CPU names
=========

ACLE does not standardize CPU names for use in command-line options and
similar contexts. Standard vendor product names should be used.

Object producers should place the CPU name in the ``Tag_CPU_name`` build
attribute.

.. _sec-Feature-test-macros:

Feature test macros
###################

Introduction
============

The feature test macros allow programmers to determine the availability
of ACLE or subsets of it, or of target architectural features. This may
indicate the availability of some source language extensions (for example
intrinsics) or the likely level of performance of some standard C
features, such as integer division and floating-point.

Several macros are defined as numeric values to indicate the level of
support for particular features. These macros are undefined if the
feature is not present. (Aside: in Standard C/C++, references to
undefined macros expand to 0 in preprocessor expressions, so a
comparison such as::

  #if __ARM_ARCH >= 7

will have the expected effect of evaluating to false if the macro is not
defined.)

All ACLE macros begin with the prefix ``__ARM_.`` All ACLE macros expand
to integral constant expressions suitable for use in an #if directive,
unless otherwise specified. Syntactically, they must be
primary-expressions generally this means an implementation should
enclose them in parentheses if they are not simple constants.

.. _ssec-TfACLE:

Testing for Arm C Language Extensions
=====================================

``__ARM_ACLE`` is defined to the version of this specification
implemented, as ``100 * major_version + minor_version``. An implementation
implementing version 2.1 of the ACLE specification will define
``__ARM_ACLE`` as 201.

.. _ssec-Endi:

Endianness
==========

``__ARM_BIG_ENDIAN`` is defined as 1 if data is stored by default in
big-endian format. If the macro is not set, data is stored in
little-endian format. (Aside: the "mixed-endian" format for
double-precision numbers, used on some very old Arm FPU implementations,
is not supported by ACLE or the Arm ABI.)

A32 and T32 instruction set architecture and features
=======================================================

References to the target architecture refer to the target as
configured in the tools, for example by appropriate command-line
options. This may be a subset or intersection of actual targets, in
order to produce a binary that runs on more than one real architecture.
For example, use of specific features may be disabled.

In some cases, hardware features may be accessible from only one or
other of A32 or T32 state. For example, in the v5TE and v6
architectures, DSP instructions and (where available) VFP
instructions, are only accessible in A32 state, while in the v7-R
architecture, hardware divide is only accessible from T32 state. Where
both states are available, the implementation should set feature test
macros indicating that the hardware feature is accessible. To provide
access to the hardware feature, an implementation might override the
programmer's preference for target instruction set, or generate an
interworking call to a helper function. This mechanism is outside the
scope of ACLE. In cases where the implementation is given a hard
requirement to use only one state (for example to support validation, or
post-processing) then it should set feature test macros only for the
hardware features available in that state as if compiling for a core
where the other instruction set was not present.

An implementation that allows a user to indicate which functions go into
which state (either as a hard requirement or a preference) is not
required to change the settings of architectural feature test macros.

.. _ssec-ATisa:

A32/T32 instruction set architecture
--------------------------------------

``__ARM_ARCH`` is defined as an integer value indicating the current Arm
instruction set architecture (for example 7 for the Arm v7-A architecture
implemented by Cortex-A8 or the Armv7-M architecture implemented by
Cortex-M3 or 8 for the Armv8-A architecture implemented by Cortex-A57).
Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81]_ onwards, the value of ``__ARM_ARCH`` is scaled up to
include minor versions. The formula to calculate the value of
``__ARM_ARCH`` from Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81]_ onwards is given by the following
formula::

  For an Arm architecture ArmvX.Y, __ARM_ARCH = X * 100 + Y. E.g.
  for Armv8.1 __ARM_ARCH = 801.

Since ACLE only supports the Arm architecture, this macro would always
be defined in an ACLE implementation.

Note that the ``__ARM_ARCH`` macro is defined even for cores which only
support the T32 instruction set.

``__ARM_ARCH_ISA_ARM`` is defined to 1 if the core supports the Arm
instruction set. It is not defined for M-profile cores.

``__ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB`` is defined to 1 if the core supports the
original T32 instruction set (including the v6-M architecture) and 2
if it supports the T32 instruction set as found in the v6T2
architecture and all v7 architectures.

``__ARM_ARCH_ISA_A64`` is defined to 1 if the core supports AArch64's
A64 instruction set.

``__ARM_32BIT_STATE`` is defined to 1 if code is being generated for
AArch32.

``__ARM_64BIT_STATE`` is defined to 1 if code is being generated for
AArch64.

.. _ssec-Archp:

Architectural profile (A, R, M or pre-Cortex)
---------------------------------------------

``__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE`` is defined to be one of the char literals
``'A'``, ``'R'``, ``'M'`` or ``'S'``, or unset, according to the
architectural profile of the target. ``'S'`` indicates the common
subset of the A and R profiles. The common subset of the A, R and M
profiles is indicated by::

  __ARM_ARCH == 7 && !defined (__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE)

This macro corresponds to the ``Tag_CPU_arch_profile`` object build
attribute. It may be useful to writers of system code. It is expected in
most cases programmers will use more feature-specific tests.

The macro is undefined for architectural targets which predate the use
of architectural profiles.

.. _ssec-Uasih:

Unaligned access supported in hardware
--------------------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED`` is defined if the target supports unaligned
access in hardware, at least to the extent of being able to load or
store an integer word at any alignment with a single instruction. (There
may be restrictions on load-multiple and floating-point accesses.) Note
that whether a code generation target permits unaligned access will in
general depend on the settings of system register bits, so an
implementation should define this macro to match the user's expectations
and intentions. For example, a command-line option might be provided to
disable the use of unaligned access, in which case this macro would not
be defined.

.. _ssec-LDREX:

LDREX/STREX
-----------

This feature was deprecated in ACLE 2.0. It is strongly recommended that
C11/C++11 atomics be used instead.

``__ARM_FEATURE_LDREX`` is defined if the load/store-exclusive
instructions (LDREX/STREX) are supported. Its value is a set of bits
indicating available widths of the access, as powers of 2. The following
bits are used:

+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| **Bit**            | **Value**          | **Access width**   | **Instruction**    |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 0                  | 0x01               | byte               | LDREXB/STREXB      |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 1                  | 0x02               | halfword           | LDREXH/STREXH      |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 2                  | 0x04               | word               | LDREX/STREX        |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 3                  | 0x08               | doubleword         | LDREXD/STREXD      |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Other bits are reserved.

The following values of ``__ARM_FEATURE_LDREX`` may occur:

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| **Macro value**          | **Access widths**        | **Example architecture** |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| (undefined)              | none                     | Armv5, Armv6-M           |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 0x04                     | word                     | Armv6                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 0x07                     | word, halfword, byte     | Armv7-M                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 0x0F                     | doubleword, word,        | Armv6K, Armv7-A/R        |
|                          | halfword, byte           |                          |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

Other values are reserved.

The LDREX/STREX instructions are introduced in recent versions of the
Arm architecture and supersede the SWP instruction. Where both are
available, Arm strongly recommends programmers to use LDREX/STREX rather
than SWP. Note that platforms may choose to make SWP unavailable in user
mode and emulate it through a trap to a platform routine, or fault it.

.. _ssec-ATOMICS:

Large System Extensions
-----------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_ATOMICS`` is defined if the Large System Extensions introduced in
the Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81]_ architecture are supported on this target.
Note: It is strongly recommended that standardized C11/C++11 atomics are used to
implement atomic operations in user code.

.. _ssec-CLZ:

CLZ
---

``__ARM_FEATURE_CLZ`` is defined to 1 if the CLZ (count leading zeroes)
instruction is supported in hardware. Note that ACLE provides the
``__clz()`` family of intrinsics (see ssec-Mdpi_) even
when ``__ARM_FEATURE_CLZ`` is not defined.

.. _ssec-Qflag:

Q (saturation) flag
-------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_QBIT`` is defined to 1 if the Q (saturation) global flag
exists and the intrinsics defined in ssec-Qflag2_ are available. This
flag is used with the DSP saturating-arithmetic instructions (such
as QADD) and the width-specified saturating instructions (SSAT and USAT).
Note that either of these classes of instructions may exist without the
other: for example, v5E has only QADD while v7-M has only SSAT.

Intrinsics associated with the Q-bit and their feature macro
``__ARM_FEATURE_QBIT`` are deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They
are fully supported for M-profile and R-profile. This macro is defined
for AArch32 only.

.. _ssec-DSPins:

DSP instructions
----------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_DSP`` is defined to 1 if the DSP (v5E) instructions are
supported and the intrinsics defined in ssec-Satin_ are available.
These instructions include QADD, SMULBB and others. This feature also implies
support for the Q flag.

``__ARM_FEATURE_DSP`` and its associated intrinsics are deprecated in
ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They are fully supported for M and R-profiles.
This macro is defined for AArch32 only.

.. _ssec-Satins:

Saturation instructions
-----------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_SAT`` is defined to 1 if the SSAT and USAT instructions
are supported and the intrinsics defined in ssec-Wsatin_ are
available. This feature also implies support for the Q flag.

``__ARM_FEATURE_SAT`` and its associated intrinsics are deprecated in
ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They are fully supported for M and R-profiles.
This macro is defined for AArch32 only.

32-bit SIMD instructions
------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is defined to 1 if the 32-bit SIMD instructions
are supported and the intrinsics defined in ssec-32SIMD_ are
available. This also implies support for the GE global flags which
indicate byte-by-byte comparison results.

``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. Users
are encouraged to use Neon Intrinsics as an equivalent for the 32-bit
SIMD intrinsics functionality. However they are fully supported for M
and R-profiles. This is defined for AArch32 only.

.. _ssec-HID:

Hardware integer divide
-----------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_IDIV`` is defined to 1 if the target has hardware
support for 32-bit integer division in all available instruction sets.
Signed and unsigned versions are both assumed to be available. The
intention is to allow programmers to choose alternative algorithm
implementations depending on the likely speed of integer division.

Some older R-profile targets have hardware divide available in the T32
instruction set only. This can be tested for using the following test:

::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_IDIV || (__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE == 'R')

.. _ssec-TME:

Transactional Memory Extension
------------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_TME`` is defined to ``1`` if the Transactional Memory
Extension instructions are supported in hardware and intrinsics defined
in sec-TME-intrinsics_ are available.

.. _ssec-HWFPSIMD:

Floating-point, Advanced SIMD (Neon) and MVE hardware
=====================================================

.. _ssec-HWFP:

Hardware floating point
-----------------------

``__ARM_FP`` is set if hardware floating-point is available. The value is
a set of bits indicating the floating-point precisions supported. The

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

Other values are reserved.

Standard C implementations support single and double precision
floating-point irrespective of whether floating-point hardware is
available. However, an implementation might choose to offer a mode to
diagnose or fault use of floating-point arithmetic at a precision not
supported in hardware.

Support for 16-bit floating-point language or 16-bit brain floating-point
language extensions (see ssec-FP16fmt_ and ssec-BF16fmt_) is only
required if supported in hardware

.. _ssec-FP16fmt:

Half-precision (16-bit) floating-point format
---------------------------------------------

``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE`` is defined to 1 if the IEEE 754-2008
[IEEE-FP]_ 16-bit floating-point format is used.

``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` is defined to 1 if the Arm
alternative [ARMARM]_ 16-bit floating-point format is used. This format
removes support for infinities and NaNs in order to provide an 
additional binade.

At most one of these macros will be defined. See ssec-fp16-type_
for details of half-precision floating-point types.

.. _ssec-BF16fmt:

Brain half-precision (16-bit) floating-point format
----------------------------------------------------

``__ARM_BF16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` is defined to 1 if the Arm
alternative [ARMARM]_ 16-bit brain floating-point format is used. This format
closely resembles the IEEE 754 single-precision format.  As such a brain
half-precision floating point value can be converted to an IEEE 754
single-floating point format by appending 16 zero bits at the end.

``__ARM_FEATURE_BF16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC`` is defined to ``1`` if the brain 16-bit
floating-point arithmetic instructions are supported in hardware and the
associated vector intrinsics defined by ACLE are available. Note that
this implies:

 * ``__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1``
 * ``__ARM_NEON_FP & 0x02 == 1``

See ssec-bf16-type_ for details of half-precision brain floating-point
types.

.. _ssec-FMA:

Fused multiply-accumulate (FMA)
-------------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_FMA`` is defined to 1 if the hardware floating-point
architecture supports fused floating-point multiply-accumulate, i.e.
without intermediate rounding. Note that C implementations are
encouraged [C99]_ (7.12) to ensure that <math.h> defines ``FP_FAST_FMAF`` or
``FP_FAST_FMA,`` which can be tested by portable C code. A C
implementation on Arm might define these macros by testing
``__ARM_FEATURE_FMA`` and ``__ARM_FP.``

.. _ssec-NEON:

Advanced SIMD architecture extension (Neon)
-------------------------------------------

``__ARM_NEON`` is defined to a value indicating the Advanced SIMD (Neon)
architecture supported. The only current value is 1.

In principle, for AArch32, the Neon architecture can exist in an
integer-only version. To test for the presence of Neon floating-point
vector instructions, test ``__ARM_NEON_FP.`` When Neon does occur in an
integer-only version, the VFP scalar instruction set is also not
present. See [ARMARM]_ (table A2-4) for architecturally permitted
combinations.

``__ARM_NEON`` is always set to 1 for AArch64.

.. _ssec-NEONfp:

Neon floating-point
-------------------

``__ARM_NEON_FP`` is defined as a bitmap to indicate floating-point
support in the Neon architecture. The meaning of the values is the same
as for ``__ARM_FP.`` This macro is undefined when the Neon extension is
not present or does not support floating-point.

Current AArch32 Neon implementations do not support double-precision
floating-point even when it is present in VFP. 16-bit floating-point
format is supported in Neon if and only if it is supported in VFP.
Consequently, the definition of ``__ARM_NEON_FP`` is the same as
``__ARM_FP`` except that the bit to indicate double-precision is not set
for AArch32. Double-precision is always set for AArch64.

If ``__ARM_FEATURE_FMA`` and ``__ARM_NEON_FP`` are both defined,
fused-multiply instructions are available in Neon also.

.. _ssec-MVE:

M-profile Vector Extension
--------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_MVE`` is defined as a bitmap to indicate M-profile Vector
Extension (MVE) support.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| **Bit**                  | **Value**                | **Support**         |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| 0                        | 0x01                     | Integer MVE         |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| 1                        | 0x02                     | Floating-point MVE  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+

.. _ssec-WMMX:

Wireless MMX
------------

If Wireless MMX operations are available on the target, ``__ARM_WMMX`` is
defined to a value that indicates the level of support, corresponding to
the ``Tag_WMMX_arch`` build attribute.

This specification does not further define source-language features to
support Wireless MMX.

.. _ssec-CrypE:

Crypto extension
----------------

NOTE: The ``__ARM_FEATURE_CRYPTO`` macro is deprecated in favor of the finer
grained feature macros described below.

``__ARM_FEATURE_CRYPTO`` is defined to 1 if the Armv8-A Crypto instructions are
supported and intrinsics targeting them are available. These
instructions include AES{E, D}, SHA1{C, P, M} and others. This also implies
``__ARM_FEATURE_AES`` and ``__ARM_FEATURE_SHA2``.

.. _ssec-AES:

when ``__ARM_ARCH >= 8``.

.. _ssec-rng:

instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in ssec-rand_
are available.

.. _ssec-v8rnd:

instructions and their associated intrinsics are available.

.. _ssec-fp16-arith:

16-bit floating-point data processing operations
------------------------------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC`` is defined to ``1`` if the
16-bit floating-point arithmetic instructions are supported in hardware and
the associated scalar intrinsics defined by ACLE are available. Note that
this implies:

 * ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE == 1``
 * ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 0``
 * ``__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1``

``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC`` is defined to ``1`` if the 16-bit

this implies:

 * ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE == 1``
 * ``__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 0``
 * ``__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1``
 * ``__ARM_NEON_FP & 0x02 == 1``

.. _ssec-JCVT:

Javascript floating-point conversion
------------------------------------

``__ARM_FEATURE_JCVT`` is defined to 1 if the FJCVTZS (AArch64) or
VJCVT (AArch32) instruction and the associated intrinsic is available.
 
.. _ssec-FPm:

Floating-point model
====================

These macros test the floating-point model implemented by the compiler
and libraries. The model determines the guarantees on arithmetic and
exceptions.

``__ARM_FP_FAST`` is defined to 1 if floating-point optimizations may
occur such that the computed results are different from those prescribed
by the order of operations according to the C standard. Examples of such
optimizations would be reassociation of expressions to reduce depth, and
replacement of a division by constant with multiplication by its
reciprocal.

``__ARM_FP_FENV_ROUNDING`` is defined to 1 if the implementation allows
the rounding to be configured at runtime using the standard C
fesetround() function and will apply this rounding to future
floating-point operations. The rounding mode applies to both scalar
floating-point and Neon.

The floating-point implementation might or might not support denormal
values. If denormal values are not supported then they are flushed to
zero.

Implementations may also define the following macros in appropriate
floating-point modes:

``__STDC_IEC_559__`` is defined if the implementation conforms to IEC
This implies support for floating-point exception status flags,
including the inexact exception. This macro is specified by [C99]_
(6.10.8).

``__SUPPORT_SNAN__`` is defined if the implementation supports
signalling NaNs. This macro is specified by the C standards proposal
WG14 N965 Optional support for Signaling NaNs. (Note: this was not
adopted into C11.)

.. _ssec-Pcs:

Procedure call standard
=======================

``__ARM_PCS`` is defined to 1 if the default procedure calling standard
for the translation unit conforms to the base PCS defined in [AAPCS]_.
This is supported on AArch32 only.

``__ARM_PCS_VFP`` is defined to 1 if the default is to pass
floating-point parameters in hardware floating-point registers using the
VFP variant PCS defined in [AAPCS]_. This is supported on AArch32 only.

``__ARM_PCS_AAPCS64`` is defined to 1 if the default procedure calling
standard for the translation unit conforms to the [AAPCS64]_.

Note that this should reflect the implementation default for the
translation unit. Implementations which allow the PCS to be set for a
function, class or namespace are not expected to redefine the macro
within that scope.

.. _ssec-Pic:

Position-independent code
=========================

``__ARM_ROPI`` is defined to 1 if the translation unit is being compiled in
read-only position independent mode. In this mode, all read-only data and
functions are at a link-time constant offset from the program counter.

``__ARM_RWPI`` is defined to 1 if the translation unit is being compiled in
read-write position independent mode. In this mode, all writable data is at a
link-time constant offset from the static base register defined in [AAPCS]_.

The ROPI and RWPI position independence modes are compatible with each other,
so the ``__ARM_ROPI`` and ``__ARM_RWPI`` macros may be defined at the same
time.

.. _ssec-CoProc:

Coprocessor intrinsics
======================

``__ARM_FEATURE_COPROC`` is defined as a bitmap to indicate the presence of
coprocessor intrinsics for the target architecture. If ``__ARM_FEATURE_COPROC``
is undefined or zero, that means there is no support for coprocessor intrinsics
on the target architecture. The following bits are used:

+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Bit** | **Value** | **Intrinsics Available**                                                                |

| 0       | 0x1       | __arm_cdp __arm_ldc, __arm_ldcl, __arm_stc, __arm_stcl, __arm_mcr and __arm_mrc         |
+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1       | 0x2       | __arm_cdp2, __arm_ldc2, __arm_stc2, __arm_ldc2l, __arm_stc2l, __arm_mcr2 and __arm_mrc2 |
+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2       | 0x4       | __arm_mcrr and __arm_mrrc                                                               |
+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3       | 0x8       | __arm_mcrr2 and __arm_mrrc2                                                             |
+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

===========================================

``__ARM_FEATURE_FRINT``  is defined to 1 if the Armv8.5-A rounding number
instructions are supported and the scalar and vector intrinsics are available.
This macro may only ever be defined in the AArch64 execution state.
The scalar intrinsics are specified in ssec-Fpdpi_ and are not expected
to be for general use.  They are defined for uses that require the specialist
rounding behavior of the relevant instructions.
The vector intrinsics are specified in the Arm Neon Intrinsics Reference
Architecture Specification [Neon]_.

.. _ssec-Dot:

Dot Product extension
======================

``__ARM_FEATURE_DOTPROD``  is defined if the dot product data manipulation
instructions are supported and the vector intrinsics are available. Note that

.. _ssec-COMPLX:

Complex number intrinsics
=========================

``__ARM_FEATURE_COMPLEX`` is defined if the complex addition and complex
multiply-accumulate vector instructions are supported. Note that this implies:

 * ``__ARM_NEON == 1``

These instructions require that the input vectors are organized such that the
real and imaginary parts of the complex number are stored in alternating sequences:
real, imag, real, imag, ... etc.

.. _ssec-BTI:

Branch Target Identification
============================

``__ARM_FEATURE_BTI_DEFAULT`` is defined to 1 if the Branch Target
Identification extension is used to protect branch destinations by default.
The protection applied to any particular function may be overriden by
mechanisms such as function attributes.

``__ARM_FEATURE_BTI`` is defined to 1 if Branch Target Identification
extension is available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

.. _ssec-PAC:

Pointer Authentication
======================

``__ARM_FEATURE_PAC_DEFAULT`` is defined as a bitmap to indicate the use of the
Pointer Authentication extension to protect code against code reuse attacks
by default.
The bits are defined as follows:

+--------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Bit**                  | **Meaning**                         |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| 0                        | Protection using the A key          |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| 1                        | Protection using the B key          |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| 2                        | Protection including leaf functions |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------+

For example, a value of ``0x5`` indicates that the Pointer Authentication
extension is used to protect function entry points, including leaf functions,
using the A key for signing.
The protection applied to any particular function may be overriden by
mechanisms such as function attributes.

``__ARM_FEATURE_PAUTH`` is defined to 1 if Pointer Authentication extension
is available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

.. _ssec-MatMul:

Matrix Multiply Intrinsics
==========================

``__ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8`` is defined if the integer matrix multiply
instructions are supported. Note that this implies:

* ``__ARM_NEON == 1``

.. _ssec-CDE:

Custom Datapath Extension
==========================

``__ARM_FEATURE_CDE`` is defined to 1 if the Arm Custom Datapath Extension
(CDE) is supported.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 7                        | 0x80                     | ``p7``                        |

``ST64B``, ``ST64BV`` and ``ST64BV0`` instructions for atomic 64-byte
access to device memory are supported.
This macro may only ever be defined in the AArch64 execution state.
Intrinsics for using these instructions are specified in
ssec-LS64_.

Attributes and pragmas
######################

Attribute syntax
================

The general rules for attribute syntax are described in the GCC
documentation <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Attribute-Syntax.html>.
Briefly, for this declaration:

::

  A int B x C, D y E;

attribute ``A`` applies to both ``x`` and ``y``; ``B`` and ``C`` apply to
``x`` only, and ``D`` and ``E`` apply to ``y`` only. Programmers are
recommended to keep declarations simple if attributes are used.

Unless otherwise stated, all attribute arguments must be compile-time
constants.

Hardware/software floating-point calling convention
===================================================

The AArch32 PCS defines a base standard, as well as several variants.

On targets with hardware FP the AAPCS provides for procedure calls to
use either integer or floating-point argument and result registers. ACLE
allows this to be selectable per function.
::

  __attribute__((pcs("aapcs")))

applied to a function, selects software (integer) FP calling convention.
::

  __attribute__((pcs("aapcs-vfp")))

applied to a function, selects hardware FP calling convention.

The AArch64 PCS standard variants do not change how parameters are
passed, so no PCS attributes are supported.

The pcs attribute applies to functions and function types.
Implementations are allowed to treat the procedure call specification as
part of the type, i.e. as a language linkage in the sense of [C++
#1].

Target selection
================

The following target selection attributes are supported:

::

  __attribute__((target("arm")))

when applied to a function, forces A32 state code generation.
::

  __attribute__((target("thumb")))

when applied to a function, forces T32 state code generation.

The implementation must generate code in the required state unless it is
impossible to do so. For example, on an Armv5 or Armv6 target with VFP
(and without the T32 instruction set), if a function is forced to
T32 state, any floating-point operations or intrinsics that are only
available in A32 state must be generated as calls to library functions
or compiler-generated functions.

This attribute does not apply to AArch64.

.. _sec-Weak-linkage:

Weak linkage
============

``__attribute__((weak))`` can be attached to declarations and
definitions to indicate that they have weak static linkage (``STB_WEAK`` in
ELF objects). As definitions, they can be overridden by other
definitions of the same symbol. As references, they do not need to be
satisfied and will be resolved to zero if a definition is not present.

Patchable constants
-------------------

In addition, this specification requires that weakly defined initialized
constants are not used for constant propagation, allowing the value to
be safely changed by patching after the object is produced.

Alignment
=========

The new standards for C [C11]_ (6.7.5) and C++ [CPP11]_ (7.6.2) add syntax for
aligning objects and types. ACLE provides an alternative syntax
described in this section.

Alignment attribute
-------------------

``__attribute__((aligned(N)))`` can be associated with data, functions,
types and fields. N must be an integral constant expression and must be
a power of 2, for example 1, 2, 4, 8. The maximum alignment depends on the
storage class of the object being aligned. The size of a data type is
always a multiple of its alignment. This is a consequence of the rule in
C that the spacing between array elements is equal to the element size.

The aligned attribute does not act as a type qualifier. For example,
given::

  char x ``__attribute__((aligned(8)));``
  int y ``__attribute__((aligned(1)));``

the type of ``&x`` is ``char *`` and the type of ``&y`` is ``int *``. The
following declarations are equivalent:

::

  struct S x __attribute__((aligned(16))); /* ACLE */

  struct S _Alignas(16) x/* C11 */

  #include <stdalign.h> /* C11 (alternative) */
  struct S alignas(16) x;

  struct S alignas(16) x; /* C++11 */

.. _ssec-Aoso:

Alignment of static objects
---------------------------

The macro ``__ARM_ALIGN_MAX_PWR`` indicates (as the exponent of a power
of 2) the maximum available alignment of static data -- for example 4 for
16-byte alignment. So the following is always valid:

::

  int x __attribute__((aligned(1 << __ARM_ALIGN_MAX_PWR)));

or, using the C11/C++11 syntax:

::

  alignas(1 << __ARM_ALIGN_MAX_PWR) int x;

Since an alignment request on an object does not change its type or
size, x in this example would have type int and size 4.

There is in principle no limit on the alignment of static objects,
within the constraints of available memory. In the Arm ABI an object
with a requested alignment would go into an ELF section with at least as
strict an alignment requirement. However, an implementation supporting
position-independent dynamic objects or overlays may need to place
restrictions on their alignment demands.

.. _ssec-Aoso2:

Alignment of stack objects
--------------------------

It must be possible to align any local object up to the stack alignment
as specified in the AAPCS for AArch32 (i.e. 8 bytes) or as specified in
AAPCS64 for AArch64 (i.e. 16 bytes) this being also the maximal
alignment of any native type.

An implementation may, but is not required to, permit the allocation of
local objects with greater alignment, for example 16 or 32 bytes for AArch32.
(This would involve some runtime adjustment such that the object address
was not a fixed offset from the stack pointer on entry.)

If a program requests alignment greater than the implementation
supports, it is recommended that the compiler warn but not fault this.
Programmers should expect over-alignment of local objects to be treated
as a hint.

The macro ``__ARM_ALIGN_MAX_STACK_PWR`` indicates (as the exponent of
a power of 2) the maximum available stack alignment. For example, a
value of 3 indicates 8-byte alignment.

Procedure calls
---------------

For procedure calls, where a parameter has aligned type, data should be
passed as if it was a basic type of the given type and alignment. For
example, given the aligned type::

  struct S { int a[2]; } __attribute__((aligned(8)));

the second argument of::

  f(int, struct S);

should be passed as if it were::

  f(int, long long);

which means that in AArch32 AAPCS the second parameter is in ``R2/R3``
rather than ``R1/R2``.

Alignment of C heap storage
---------------------------

The standard C allocation functions [C99]_ (7.20.3), such as malloc(),
return storage aligned to the normal maximal alignment, i.e. the largest
alignment of any (standard) type.

Implementations may, but are not required to, provide a function to
return heap storage of greater alignment. Suitable functions are::

  int posix_memalign(void **memptr, size_t alignment, size_t size );

as defined in [POSIX]_, or::

  void *aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);

as defined in [C11]_ (7.22.3.1).

Alignment of C++ heap allocation
--------------------------------

In C++, an allocation (with new) knows the object's type. If the type
is aligned, the allocation should also be aligned. There are two cases
to consider depending on whether the user has provided an allocation
function.

If the user has provided an allocation function for an object or array
of over-aligned type, it is that function's responsibility to return
suitably aligned storage. The size requested by the runtime library will
be a multiple of the alignment (trivially so, for the non-array case).

(The AArch32 C++ ABI does not explicitly deal with the runtime behavior
when dealing with arrays of alignment greater than 8. In this situation,
any cookie will be 8 bytes as usual, immediately preceding the array;
this means that the cookie is not necessarily at the address seen by the
allocation and deallocation functions. Implementations will need to make
some adjustments before and after calls to the ABI-defined C++ runtime,
or may provide additional non-standard runtime helper functions.)
Example:

::

  struct float4 {
    void *operator new[](size_t s) {
      void *p;
      posix_memalign(&p, 16, s);
      return p;
    }
    float data[4];
  } __attribute__((aligned(16)));

If the user has not provided their own allocation function, the behavior
is implementation-defined.

The generic itanium C++ ABI, which we use in AArch64, already handles
arrays with arbitrarily aligned elements

Other attributes
================

The following attributes should be supported and their definitions
follow [GCC]_. These attributes are not specific to Arm or the Arm ABI.

``alias``, ``common``, ``nocommon``, ``noinline``, ``packed``, ``section``,
``visibility``, ``weak``

Some specific requirements on the weak attribute are detailed in
 sec-Weak-linkage_.

Synchronization, barrier, and hint intrinsics
#############################################

Introduction
============

This section provides intrinsics for managing data that may be accessed
concurrently between processors, or between a processor and a device.
Some intrinsics atomically update data, while others place barriers
around accesses to data to ensure that accesses are visible in the
correct order.

Memory prefetch intrinsics are also described in this section.

Atomic update primitives
========================

C/C++ standard atomic primitives
--------------------------------

The new C and C++ standards [C11]_ (7.17), [CPP11]_ (clause 29) provide a
comprehensive library of atomic operations and barriers, including
operations to read and write data with particular ordering requirements.
Programmers are recommended to use this where available.

IA-64/GCC atomic update primitives
----------------------------------

The ``__sync`` family of intrinsics (introduced in [IA-64]_ (section 7.4),
and as documented in the GCC documentation) may be provided, especially
if the C/C++ atomics are not available, and are recommended as being
portable and widely understood. These may be expanded inline, or call
library functions. Note that, unusually, these intrinsics are
polymorphic they will specialize to instructions suitable for the size
of their arguments.

Memory barriers
===============

Memory barriers ensure specific ordering properties between memory
accesses. For more details on memory barriers, see [ARMARM] (A3.8.3).
The intrinsics in this section are available for all targets.
They may be no-ops (i.e. generate no code, but possibly act as a code
motion barrier in compilers) on targets where the relevant instructions
do not exist, but only if the property they guarantee would have held
anyway. On targets where the relevant instructions exist but are
implemented as no-ops, these intrinsics generate the instructions.

The memory barrier intrinsics take a numeric argument indicating the
scope and access type of the barrier, as shown in the following table.
(The assembler mnemonics for these numbers, as shown in the table, are
not available in the intrinsics.) The argument should be an integral
constant expression within the required range see
sec-Constant-arguments-to-intrinsics_.

The following memory barrier intrinsics are available:
::

  void __dmb(/*constant*/ unsigned int);

Generates a DMB (data memory barrier) instruction or equivalent CP15
instruction. DMB ensures the observed ordering of memory accesses.
Memory accesses of the specified type issued before the DMB are
guaranteed to be observed (in the specified scope) before memory
accesses issued after the DMB. For example, DMB should be used between
storing data, and updating a flag variable that makes that data
available to another core.

The ``__dmb()`` intrinsic also acts as a compiler memory barrier of the
appropriate type.
::

  void __dsb(/*constant*/ unsigned int);

Generates a DSB (data synchronization barrier) instruction or equivalent
CP15 instruction. DSB ensures the completion of memory accesses. A DSB
behaves as the equivalent DMB and has additional properties. After a DSB
instruction completes, all memory accesses of the specified type issued
before the DSB are guaranteed to have completed.

The ``__dsb()`` intrinsic also acts as a compiler memory barrier of the
appropriate type.
::

  void __isb(/*constant*/ unsigned int);

Generates an ISB (instruction synchronization barrier) instruction or
equivalent CP15 instruction. This instruction flushes the processor
pipeline fetch buffers, so that following instructions are fetched from
cache or memory. An ISB is needed after some system maintenance
operations.

An ISB is also needed before transferring control to code that has been
loaded or modified in memory, for example by an overlay mechanism or
just-in-time code generator. (Note that if instruction and data caches
are separate, privileged cache maintenance operations would be needed in
order to unify the caches.)

The only supported argument for the ``__isb()`` intrinsic is 15,
corresponding to the SY (full system) scope of the ISB instruction.

Examples
--------

In this example, process ``P1`` makes some data available to process ``P2``
and sets a flag to indicate this.
::

  P1:

    value = x;
    /* issue full-system memory barrier for previous store:
       setting of flag is guaranteed not to be observed before
       write to value */
    __dmb(14);
    flag = true;

  P2:

    /* busy-wait until the data is available */
    while (!flag) {}
    /* issue full-system memory barrier: read of value is guaranteed
       not to be observed by memory system before read of flag */
    __dmb(15);
    /* use value */;

In this example, process ``P1`` makes data available to ``P2`` by putting
it on a queue.
::

  P1:

    work = new WorkItem;
    work->payload = x;
    /* issue full-system memory barrier for previous store:
       consumer cannot observe work item on queue before write to
       work item's payload */
    __dmb(14);
    queue_head = work;

  P2:

    /* busy-wait until work item appears */
    while (!(work = ``queue_head))`` {}
    /* no barrier needed: load of payload is data-dependent */
    /* use work->payload */

Hints
=====

The intrinsics in this section are available for all targets. They may
be no-ops (i.e. generate no code, but possibly act as a code motion
barrier in compilers) on targets where the relevant instructions do not
exist. On targets where the relevant instructions exist but are
implemented as no-ops, these intrinsics generate the instructions.
::

  void __wfi(void);

Generates a WFI (wait for interrupt) hint instruction, or nothing. The
WFI instruction allows (but does not require) the processor to enter a
low-power state until one of a number of asynchronous events occurs.
::

  void __wfe(void);

Generates a WFE (wait for event) hint instruction, or nothing. The WFE
instruction allows (but does not require) the processor to enter a
low-power state until some event occurs such as a SEV being issued by
another processor.
::

  void __sev(void);

Generates a SEV (send a global event) hint instruction. This causes an
event to be signaled to all processors in a multiprocessor system. It is
a NOP on a uniprocessor system.
::

  void __sevl(void);

Generates a send a local event hint instruction. This causes an event
to be signaled to only the processor executing this instruction. In a
multiprocessor system, it is not required to affect the other
processors.
::

  void __yield(void);

Generates a YIELD hint instruction. This enables multithreading software
to indicate to the hardware that it is performing a task, for example a
spin-lock, that could be swapped out to improve overall system
performance.
::

  void __dbg(/*constant*/ unsigned int);

Generates a DBG instruction. This provides a hint to debugging and
related systems. The argument must be a constant integer from 0 to 15
inclusive. See implementation documentation for the effect (if any) of
this instruction and the meaning of the argument. This is available only
when compiling for AArch32.

.. _ssec-swap:

Swap
====

``__swp`` is available for all targets. This intrinsic expands to a
sequence equivalent to the deprecated (and possibly unavailable) SWP
instruction.
::

  uint32_t __swp(uint32_t, volatile void *);

Unconditionally stores a new value at the given address, and returns the
old value.

As with the IA-64/GCC primitives described in 0, the ``__swp`` intrinsic
is polymorphic. The second argument must provide the address of a
byte-sized object or an aligned word-sized object and it must be
possible to determine the size of this object from the argument
expression.

This intrinsic is implemented by LDREX/STREX (or LDREXB/STREXB) where
available, as if by::

  uint32_t __swp(uint32_t x, volatile uint32_t *p) {
    uint32_t v;
    /* use LDREX/STREX intrinsics not specified by ACLE */
    do v = __ldrex(p); while (__strex(x, p));
    return v;
  }

or alternatively,::

  uint32_t __swp(uint32_t x, uint32_t *p) {
    uint32_t v;
    /* use IA-64/GCC atomic builtins */
    do v = *p; while (!__sync_bool_compare_and_swap(p, v, x));
    return v;
  }

It is recommended that compilers should produce a
downgradeable/upgradeable warning on encountering the ``__swp`` intrinsic.

Only if load-store exclusive instructions are not available will the
intrinsic use the SWP/SWPB instructions.

It is strongly recommended to use standard and flexible atomic
primitives such as those available in the C++ <atomic> header. ``__swp``
is provided solely to allow straightforward (and possibly automated)
replacement of explicit use of SWP in inline assembler. SWP is obsolete
in the Arm architecture, and in recent versions of the architecture, may
be configured to be unavailable in user-mode. (Aside: unconditional
atomic swap is also less powerful as a synchronization primitive than
load-exclusive/store-conditional.)

Memory prefetch intrinsics
==========================

Intrinsics are provided to prefetch data or instructions. The size of
the data or function is ignored. Note that the intrinsics may be
implemented as no-ops (i.e. not generate a prefetch instruction, if none
is available). Also, even where the architecture does provide a prefetch
instruction, a particular implementation may implement the instruction
as a no-op (i.e. the instruction has no effect).

Data prefetch
-------------

::

  void __pld(void const volatile *addr);

Generates a data prefetch instruction, if available. The argument should
be any expression that may designate a data address. The data is 
prefetched to the innermost level of cache, for reading.
::

  void __pldx(/*constant*/ unsigned int /*access_kind*/,
              /*constant*/ unsigned int /*cache_level*/,
              /*constant*/ unsigned int /*retention_policy*/,
              void const volatile *addr);

Generates a data prefetch instruction. This intrinsic allows the
specification of the expected access kind (read or write), the cache
level to load the data, the data retention policy (temporal or
streaming), The relevant arguments can only be one of the following
values.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+


Instruction prefetch
--------------------
::

  void __pli(T addr);

Generates a code prefetch instruction, if available. If a specific code
prefetch instruction is not available, this intrinsic may generate a
data-prefetch instruction to fetch the addressed code to the innermost
level of unified cache. It will not fetch code to data-cache in a split
cache level.
::

  void __plix(/*constant*/ unsigned int /*cache_level*/,
              /*constant*/ unsigned int /*retention_policy*/,
              T addr);

Generates a code prefetch instruction. This intrinsic allows the
specification of the cache level to load the code, the retention policy
(temporal or streaming). The relevant arguments can have the same values
as in ``__pldx.``


``__pldx`` and ``__plix`` arguments cache level and retention policy
are ignored on unsupported targets.

.. _ssec-nop:

NOP
===
::

  void __nop(void);

Generates an unspecified no-op instruction. Note that not all
architectures provide a distinguished NOP instruction. On those that do,
it is unspecified whether this intrinsic generates it or another
instruction. It is not guaranteed that inserting this instruction will
increase execution time.

Data-processing intrinsics
##########################

The intrinsics in this section are provided for algorithm optimization.

The ``<arm_acle.h>`` header should be included before using these
intrinsics.

Implementations are not required to introduce precisely the instructions
whose names match the intrinsics. However, implementations should aim to
ensure that a computation expressed compactly with intrinsics will
generate a similarly compact sequence of machine code. In general, C's
as-if rule [C99]_ (5.1.2.3) applies, meaning that the compiled code must
behave *as if* the instruction had been generated.

In general, these intrinsics are aimed at DSP algorithm optimization on
M-profile and R-profile. Use on A-profile is deprecated. However, the
miscellaneous intrinsics and CRC32 intrinsics described in ssec-Mdpi_
and ssec-crc32_ respectively are suitable for all profiles.

Programmer's model of global state
==================================

.. _ssec-Qflag2:

The Q (saturation) flag
-----------------------

The Q flag is a cumulative (sticky) saturation bit in the APSR
(Application Program Status Register) indicating that an operation
saturated, or in some cases, overflowed. It is set on saturation by most
intrinsics in the DSP and SIMD intrinsic sets, though some SIMD
intrinsics feature saturating operations which do not set the Q flag.

[AAPCS]_ (5.1.1) states:

The N, Z, C, V and Q flags (bits 27-31) and the GE[3:0] bits (bits
16-19) are undefined on entry to or return from a public interface.

Note that this does not state that these bits (in particular the Q flag)
are undefined across any C/C++ function call boundary only across a
public interface. The Q and GE bits could be manipulated in
well-defined ways by local functions, for example when constructing
functions to be used in DSP algorithms.

Implementations must avoid introducing instructions (such as SSAT/USAT,
or SMLABB) which affect the Q flag, if the programmer is testing whether
the Q flag was set by explicit use of intrinsics and if the
implementation's introduction of an instruction may affect the value
seen. The implementation might choose to model the definition and use
(liveness) of the Q flag in the way that it models the liveness of any
visible variable, or it might suppress introduction of Q-affecting
instructions in any routine in which the Q flag is tested.

ACLE does not define how or whether the Q flag is preserved across
function call boundaries. (This is seen as an area for future
specification.)

In general, the Q flag should appear to C/C++ code in a similar way to
the standard floating-point cumulative exception flags, as global (or
thread-local) state that can be tested, set or reset through an API.

The following intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_QBIT`` is
defined:

| int ``__saturation_occurred(void);``

Returns 1 if the Q flag is set, 0 if not.

| void ``__set_saturation_occurred(int);``

Sets or resets the Q flag according to the LSB of the value.
``__set_saturation_occurred(0)`` might be used before performing a
sequence of operations after which the Q flag is tested. (In general,
the Q flag cannot be assumed to be unset at the start of a function.)

| void ``__ignore_saturation(void);``

This intrinsic is a hint and may be ignored. It indicates to the
compiler that the value of the Q flag is not live (needed) at or
subsequent to the program point at which the intrinsic occurs. It may
allow the compiler to remove preceding instructions, or to change the
instruction sequence in such a way as to result in a different value of
the Q flag. (A specific example is that it may recognize clipping idioms
in C code and implement them with an instruction such as SSAT that may
set the Q flag.)

The GE flags
------------

The GE (Greater than or Equal to) flags are four bits in the APSR. They
are used with the 32-bit SIMD intrinsics described in
ssec-32SIMD_.

There are four GE flags, one for each 8-bit lane of a 32-bit SIMD
operation. Certain non-saturating 32-bit SIMD intrinsics set the GE bits
to indicate overflow of addition or subtraction. For 4x8-bit operations
the GE bits are set one for each byte. For 2x16-bit operations the GE
bits are paired together, one for the high halfword and the other pair
for the low halfword. The only supported way to read or use the GE bits
(in this specification) is by using the ``__sel`` intrinsic, see
sec-Parallel-selection_.

Floating-point environment
--------------------------

An implementation should implement the features of <fenv.h> for
accessing the floating-point runtime environment. Programmers should use
this rather than accessing the VFP FPSCR directly. For example, on a
target supporting VFP the cumulative exception flags (for example IXC, OFC) can
be read from the FPSCR by using the fetestexcept() function, and the
rounding mode (RMode) bits can be read using the fegetround() function.

ACLE does not support changing the DN, FZ or AHP bits at runtime.

VFP short vector mode (enabled by setting the Stride and Len bits) is
deprecated, and is unavailable on later VFP implementations. ACLE
provides no support for this mode.

.. _ssec-Mdpi:

Miscellaneous data-processing intrinsics
========================================

The following intrinsics perform general data-processing operations.
They have no effect on global state.

[Note: documentation of the ``__nop`` intrinsic has moved to ssec-nop_]

For completeness and to aid portability between LP64 and LLP64
models, ACLE also defines intrinsics with ``l`` suffix.
::

  uint32_t __ror(uint32_t x, uint32_t y);
  unsigned long __rorl(unsigned long x, uint32_t y);
  uint64_t __rorll(uint64_t x, uint32_t y);

Rotates the argument ``x`` right by ``y`` bits. ``y`` can take any value.
These intrinsics are available on all targets.
::

  unsigned int __clz(uint32_t x);
  unsigned int __clzl(unsigned long x);
  unsigned int __clzll(uint64_t x);

Returns the number of leading zero bits in ``x``. When ``x`` is zero it
returns the argument width, i.e. 32 or 64. These intrinsics are available
on all targets. On targets without the CLZ instruction it should be
implemented as an instruction sequence or a call to such a sequence. A
suitable sequence can be found in [Warren]_ (fig. 5-7). Hardware support
for these intrinsics is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_CLZ``.
::

  unsigned int __cls(uint32_t x);
  unsigned int __clsl(unsigned long x);
  unsigned int __clsll(uint64_t x);

Returns the number of leading sign bits in ``x``. When ``x`` is zero it
returns the argument width - 1, i.e. 31 or 63. These intrinsics are
available on all targets. On targets without the CLZ instruction it
should be implemented as an instruction sequence or a call to such a
sequence. Fast hardware implementation (using a CLS instruction or a short code
sequence involving the CLZ instruction) is indicated by
``__ARM_FEATURE_CLZ.``
::

  uint32_t __rev(uint32_t);
  unsigned long __revl(unsigned long);
  uint64_t __revll(uint64_t);

Reverses the byte order within a word or doubleword. These intrinsics
are available on all targets and should be expanded to an efficient
straight-line code sequence on targets without byte reversal
instructions.
::

  uint32_t __rev16(uint32_t);
  unsigned long __rev16l(unsigned long);
  uint64_t __rev16ll(uint64_t);

Reverses the byte order within each halfword of a word. For example,
``0x12345678`` becomes ``0x34127856``. These intrinsics are available on
all targets and should be expanded to an efficient straight-line code
sequence on targets without byte reversal instructions.
::

  int16_t __revsh(int16_t);

Reverses the byte order in a 16-bit value and returns the signed 16-bit result.
For example, ``0x0080`` becomes ``0x8000``. This intrinsic is available on
all targets and should be expanded to an efficient straight-line code
sequence on targets without byte reversal instructions.
::

  uint32_t __rbit(uint32_t x);
  unsigned long __rbitl(unsigned long x);
  uint64_t __rbitll(uint64_t x);

Reverses the bits in ``x``. These intrinsics are only available on targets
with the RBIT instruction.

Examples
--------

::

  #ifdef __ARM_BIG_ENDIAN
  #define htonl(x) (uint32_t)(x)
  #define htons(x) (uint16_t)(x)
  #else /* little-endian */
  #define htonl(x) __rev(x)
  #define htons(x) (uint16_t)__revsh(x)
  #endif /* endianness */
  #define ntohl(x) htonl(x)
  #define ntohs(x) htons(x)

  /* Count leading sign bits */
  inline unsigned int count_sign(int32_t x) { return __clz(x ^ (x << 1)); }
  
  /* Count trailing zeroes */
  inline unsigned int count_trail(uint32_t x) {
  #if (__ARM_ARCH >= 6 && __ARM_ISA_THUMB >= 2) || __ARM_ARCH >= 7
  /* RBIT is available */
    return __clz(__rbit(x));
  #else
    unsigned int n = __clz(x & -x);   /* get the position of the last bit */
    return n == 32 ? n : (31-n);
  #endif
  }

16-bit multiplications
======================

The intrinsics in this section provide direct access to the 16x16 and
16x32 bit multiplies introduced in Armv5E. Compilers are also
encouraged to exploit these instructions from C code. These intrinsics
are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_DSP`` is defined, and are not
available on non-5E targets. These multiplies cannot overflow.
::

  int32_t __smulbb(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies two 16-bit signed integers, i.e. the low halfwords of the
operands.
::

  int32_t __smulbt(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the low halfword of the first operand and the high halfword
of the second operand.
::

  int32_t __smultb(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the high halfword of the first operand and the low halfword
of the second operand.
::

  int32_t __smultt(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the high halfwords of the operands.
::

  int32_t __smulwb(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the 32-bit signed first operand with the low halfword (as a
16-bit signed integer) of the second operand. Return the top 32 bits of
the 48-bit product.
::

  int32_t __smulwt(int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the 32-bit signed first operand with the high halfword (as a
16-bit signed integer) of the second operand. Return the top 32 bits of
the 48-bit product.

.. _ssec-Satin:

Saturating intrinsics
=====================

.. _ssec-Wsatin:

Width-specified saturation intrinsics
-------------------------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_SAT`` is defined.
They saturate a 32-bit value at a given bit position. The saturation
width must be an integral constant expression |--| see
sec-Constant-arguments-to-intrinsics_.

::

  int32_t __ssat(int32_t, /*constant*/ unsigned int);

Saturates a signed integer to the given bit width in the range 1 to 32.
For example, the result of saturation to 8-bit width will be in the
range -128 to 127. The Q flag is set if the operation saturates.
::

  uint32_t __usat(int32_t, /*constant*/ unsigned int);

Saturates a signed integer to an unsigned (non-negative) integer of a
bit width in the range 0 to 31. For example, the result of saturation to
8-bit width is in the range 0 to 255, with all negative inputs going to
zero. The Q flag is set if the operation saturates.

Saturating addition and subtraction intrinsics
----------------------------------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_DSP`` is defined.

The saturating intrinsics operate on 32-bit signed integer data. There
are no special saturated or fixed point types.
::

  int32_t __qadd(int32_t, int32_t);

Adds two 32-bit signed integers, with saturation. Sets the Q flag if the
addition saturates.
::

  int32_t __qsub(int32_t, int32_t);

Subtracts two 32-bit signed integers, with saturation. Sets the Q flag
if the subtraction saturates.
::

  int32_t __qdbl(int32_t);

Doubles a signed 32-bit number, with saturation. ``__qdbl(x)`` is equal to
``__qadd(x,x)`` except that the argument x is evaluated only once. Sets
the Q flag if the addition saturates.

Accumulating multiplications
----------------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_DSP`` is defined.
::

  int32_t __smlabb(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies two 16-bit signed integers, the low halfwords of the first
two operands, and adds to the third operand. Sets the Q flag if the
addition overflows. (Note that the addition is the usual 32-bit modulo
addition which wraps on overflow, not a saturating addition. The
multiplication cannot overflow.)::

  int32_t __smlabt(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the low halfword of the first operand and the high halfword
of the second operand, and adds to the third operand, as for ``__smlabb``.
::

  int32_t __smlatb(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the high halfword of the first operand and the low halfword
of the second operand, and adds to the third operand, as for ``__smlabb``.
::

  int32_t __smlatt(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the high halfwords of the first two operands and adds to the
third operand, as for ``__smlabb``.
::

  int32_t __smlawb(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the 32-bit signed first operand with the low halfword (as a
16-bit signed integer) of the second operand. Adds the top 32 bits of
the 48-bit product to the third operand. Sets the Q flag if the addition
overflows. (See note for ``__smlabb``).
::

  int32_t __smlawt(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t);

Multiplies the 32-bit signed first operand with the high halfword (as a
16-bit signed integer) of the second operand and adds the top 32 bits of
the 48-bit result to the third operand as for ``__smlawb``.

Examples
--------

The ACLE DSP intrinsics can be used to define ETSI/ITU-T basic
operations [G.191]_: ::

  #include <arm_acle.h>
  inline int32_t L_add(int32_t x, int32_t y) { return __qadd(x, y); }
  inline int32_t L_negate(int32_t x) { return __qsub(0, x); }
  inline int32_t L_mult(int16_t x, int16_t y) { return __qdbl(x*y); }
  inline int16_t add(int16_t x, int16_t y) { return (int16_t)(__qadd(x<<16, y<<16) >> 16); }
  inline int16_t norm_l(int32_t x) { return __clz(x ^ (x<<1)) & 31; }
  ...

This example assumes the implementation preserves the Q flag on return
from an inline function.

.. _ssec-32SIMD:

32-bit SIMD intrinsics
======================

Availability
------------

Armv6 introduced instructions to perform 32-bit SIMD operations (i.e.
two 16-bit operations or four 8-bit operations) on the Arm
general-purpose registers. These instructions are not related to the
much more versatile Advanced SIMD (Neon) extension, whose support is
described in sec-NEON-intrinsics_.

The 32-bit SIMD intrinsics are available on targets featuring Armv6 and
upwards, including the A and R profiles. In the M profile they are
available in the Armv7E-M architecture. Availability of the 32-bit SIMD
intrinsics implies availability of the saturating intrinsics.

Availability of the SIMD intrinsics is indicated by the
``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` predefine.

To access the intrinsics, the ``<arm_acle.h>`` header should be included.

Data types for 32-bit SIMD intrinsics
-------------------------------------

The header ``<arm_acle.h>`` should be included before using these
intrinsics.

The SIMD intrinsics generally operate on and return 32-bit words
consisting of two 16-bit or four 8-bit values. These are represented as
``int16x2_t`` and ``int8x4_t`` below for illustration. Some intrinsics also
feature scalar accumulator operands and/or results.

When defining the intrinsics, implementations can define SIMD operands
using a 32-bit integral type (such as ``unsigned int``).

The header ``<arm_acle.h>`` defines typedefs ``int16x2_t``, ``uint16x2_t``,
``int8x4_t``, and ``uint8x4_t.`` These should be defined as 32-bit integral
types of the appropriate sign. There are no intrinsics provided to pack
or unpack values of these types. This can be done with shifting and
masking operations.

Use of the Q flag by 32-bit SIMD intrinsics
-------------------------------------------

Some 32-bit SIMD instructions may set the Q flag described in
ssec-Qflag2_. The behavior of the intrinsics matches that of the instructions.

Generally, instructions that perform lane-by-lane saturating operations
do not set the Q flag. For example, ``__qadd16`` does not set the Q flag,
even if saturation occurs in one or more lanes.

The explicit saturation operations ``__ssat`` and ``__usat`` set the Q flag
if saturation occurs. Similarly, ``__ssat16`` and ``__usat16`` set the Q
flag if saturation occurs in either lane.

Some instructions, such as ``__smlad``, set the Q flag if overflow occurs
on an accumulation, even though the accumulation is not a saturating
operation (i.e. does not clip its result to the limits of the type).

In the following descriptions of intrinsics, if the description does not
mention whether the intrinsic affects the Q flag, the intrinsic does not
affect it.

Parallel 16-bit saturation
--------------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is defined.
They saturate two 16-bit values to a given bit width as for the ``__ssat``
and ``__usat`` intrinsics defined in ssec-wsatin_. ::

    int16x2_t __ssat16(int16x2_t, /*constant*/ unsigned int);

Saturates two 16-bit signed values to a width in the range 1 to 16. The
Q flag is set if either operation saturates.
::

    int16x2_t __usat16(int16x2_t, /*constant */ unsigned int);

Saturates two 16-bit signed values to a bit width in the range 0 to 15.
The input values are signed and the output values are non-negative, with
all negative inputs going to zero. The Q flag is set if either operation
saturates.

Packing and unpacking
---------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is defined.
::

  int16x2_t __sxtab16(int16x2_t, int8x4_t);

Two values (at bit positions 0..7 and 16..23) are extracted from the
second operand, sign-extended to 16 bits, and added to the first
operand.
::

  int16x2_t __sxtb16(int8x4_t);

Two values (at bit positions 0..7 and 16..23) are extracted from the
first operand, sign-extended to 16 bits, and returned as the result.
::

  uint16x2_t __uxtab16(uint16x2_t, uint8x4_t);

Two values (at bit positions 0..7 and 16..23) are extracted from the
second operand, zero-extended to 16 bits, and added to the first
operand.
::

  uint16x2_t __uxtb16(uint8x4_t);

Two values (at bit positions 0..7 and 16..23) are extracted from the
first operand, zero-extended to 16 bits, and returned as the result.

.. _sec-Parallel-selection:

Parallel selection
------------------

This intrinsic is available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is defined.
::

  uint8x4_t __sel(uint8x4_t, uint8x4_t);

Selects each byte of the result from either the first operand or the
second operand, according to the values of the GE bits. For each result
byte, if the corresponding GE bit is set then the byte from the first
operand is used, otherwise the byte from the second operand is used.
Because of the way that ``int16x2_t`` operations set two (duplicate) GE
bits per value, the ``__sel`` intrinsic works equally well on
``(u)int16x2_t`` and ``(u)int8x4_t`` data.

Parallel 8-bit addition and subtraction
---------------------------------------

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32`` is defined.
Each intrinsic performs 8-bit parallel addition or subtraction. In some
cases the result may be halved or saturated.
::

  int8x4_t __qadd8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit addition, saturated to the range ``-2**7`` to ``2**7-1``.
::

  int8x4_t __qsub8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit subtraction, with saturation.
::

  int8x4_t __sadd8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit signed addition. The GE bits are set according to the results.
::

  int8x4_t __shadd8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit signed addition, halving the results.
::

  int8x4_t __shsub8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit signed subtraction, halving the results.
::

  int8x4_t __ssub8(int8x4_t, int8x4_t);

4x8-bit signed subtraction. The GE bits are set according to the
results.
::

  uint8x4_t __uadd8(uint8x4_t, uint8x4_t);

Examples
--------

Taking the elementwise maximum of two SIMD values each of which consists
of four 8-bit signed numbers:

::

  int8x4_t max8x4(int8x4_t x, int8x4_t y) { __ssub8(x, y); return __sel(x, y); }

As described in :ref:sec-Parallel-selection, where SIMD values
consist of two 16-bit unsigned numbers:

::

  int16x2_t max16x2(int16x2_t x, int16x2_t y) { __usub16(x, y); return __sel(x, y); }

Note that even though the result of the subtraction is not used, the
compiler must still generate the instruction, because of its side-effect
on the GE bits which are tested by the ``__sel()`` intrinsic.

.. _ssec-Fpdpi:

Floating-point data-processing intrinsics
=========================================

The intrinsics in this section provide direct access to selected
floating-point instructions. They are defined only if the appropriate
precision is available in hardware, as indicated by ``__ARM_FP`` (see
ssec-HWFP_). ::

  double __sqrt(double x);
  float __sqrtf(float x);

The ``__sqrt`` intrinsics compute the square root of their operand. They
have no effect on errno. Negative values produce a default NaN
result and possible floating-point exception as described in [ARMARM]
(A2.7.7). ::

  double __fma(double x, double y, double z);
  float __fmaf(float x, float y, float z);

The ``__fma`` intrinsics compute ``(x*y)+z``, without intermediate rounding.
These intrinsics are available only if ``__ARM_FEATURE_FMA`` is defined.
On a Standard C implementation it should not normally be necessary to
use these intrinsics, because the fma functions defined in [C99] (7.12.13)
should expand directly to the instructions if available.
::

  float __rintnf (float);
  double __rintn (double);

The ``__rintn`` intrinsics perform a floating point round to integral, to
nearest with ties to even. The ``__rintn`` intrinsic is available when
``__ARM_FEATURE_DIRECTED_ROUNDING`` is defined to 1. For other rounding
modes like |lsquo| to nearest with ties to away |rsquo| it is strongly recommended
that C99 standard functions be used. To achieve a floating point convert
to integer, rounding to |lsquo| nearest with ties to even |rsquo| operation, use these
rounding functions with a type-cast to integral values. For example:
::

  (int) __rintnf (a);

maps to a floating point convert to signed integer, rounding to
nearest with ties to even operation.
::

  int32_t __jcvt (double);

Converts a double-precision floating-point number to a 32-bit signed
integer following the Javascript Convert instruction semantics [ARMARMv83]_.
The ``__jcvt`` intrinsic is available if ``__ARM_FEATURE_JCVT`` is defined.

::

  float __rint32zf (float);
  double __rint32z (double);
  float __rint64zf (float);
  double __rint64z (double);
  float __rint32xf (float);
  double __rint32x (double);
  float __rint64xf (float);
  double __rint64x (double);

These intrinsics round their floating-point argument to a floating-point value
that would be representable in a 32-bit or 64-bit signed integer type.
Out-of-Range values are forced to the Most Negative Integer representable in
the target size, and an Invalid Operation Floating-Point Exception is
generated.  The rounding mode can be either the ambient rounding mode
(for example ``__rint32xf``) or towards zero (for example ``__rint32zf``).

These instructions are introduced in the Armv8.5-A extensions
[ARMARMv85]_ and are available only in the AArch64 execution state.
The intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_FRINT`` is defined.

.. _ssec-rand:

Random number generation intrinsics
===================================

The Random number generation intrinsics provide access to the Random Number
instructions introduced in Armv8.5-A.  These intrinsics are only defined for
the AArch64 execution state and are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_RNG``
is defined.
::

  int __rndr (uint64_t *);

Stores a 64-bit random number into the object pointed to by the argument and
returns zero.
If the implementation could not generate a random number  within a reasonable
period of time the object pointed to by the input is set to zero and a non-zero
value is returned.
::

  int __rndrrs (uint64_t *);

Reseeds the random number generator.  After that stores a 64-bit random number
into the object pointed to by the argument and returns zero.
If the implementation could not generate a random number within a reasonable
period of time the object pointed to by the input is set to zero and a
non-zero value is returned.


These intrinsics have side-effects on the system beyond their results.
Implementations must preserve them even if the results of the intrinsics are
unused.

To access these intrinsics, ``<arm_acle.h>`` should be included.

.. _ssec-crc32:

CRC32 intrinsics
================

CRC32 intrinsics provide direct access to CRC32 instructions
CRC32{C}{B, H, W, X} in both Armv8 AArch32 and AArch64 execution states.
These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_CRC32`` is defined.
::

  uint32_t __crc32b (uint32_t a, uint8_t b);

Performs CRC-32 checksum from bytes.
::

  uint32_t __crc32h (uint32_t a, uint16_t b);

Performs CRC-32 checksum from half-words.
::

  uint32_t __crc32w (uint32_t a, uint32_t b);

Performs CRC-32 checksum from double words.
::

  uint32_t __crc32cb (uint32_t a, uint8_t b);

Performs CRC-32C checksum from bytes.
::

  uint32_t __crc32ch (uint32_t a, uint16_t b);

Performs CRC-32C checksum from half-words.
::

  uint32_t __crc32cw (uint32_t a, uint32_t b);

Performs CRC-32C checksum from words.
::

  uint32_t __crc32cd (uint32_t a, uint64_t b);

Performs CRC-32C checksum from double words.

To access these intrinsics, ``<arm_acle.h>`` should be included.

.. _ssec-LS64:

Load/store 64 Byte intrinsics
=============================

These intrinsics provide direct access to the Armv8.7-A ``LD64B``,
``ST64B``, ``ST64BV`` and ``ST64BV0`` instructions for atomic 64-byte
access to device memory.
These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_LS64`` is defined.

The header ``<arm_acle.h>`` defines these intrinsics, and also the
data type ``data512_t`` that they use.

The type ``data512_t`` is a 64-byte structure type containing a single
member ``val`` which is an array of 8 ``uint64_t``, as if declared
like this: ::

    typedef struct {
        uint64_t val[8];
    } data512_t;

The following intrinsics are defined on this data type. In all cases,
the address ``addr`` must be aligned to a multiple of 64 bytes.
::

    data512_t __arm_ld64b(const void *addr);

Loads 64 bytes of data atomically from the address ``addr``. The
address must be in a memory region that supports 64-byte load/store
operations.
::

    void __arm_st64b(void *addr, data512_t value);

Stores the 64 bytes in ``value`` atomically to the address ``addr``. The
address must be in a memory region that supports 64-byte load/store
operations.
::

    uint64_t __arm_st64bv(void *addr, data512_t value);

Attempts to store the 64 bytes in ``value`` atomically to the address
``addr``.  It returns a 64-bit value from the response of the device
written to.

::

    uint64_t __arm_st64bv0(void *addr, data512_t value);

Performs the same operation as ``__arm_st64bv``, except that the data
stored to memory is modified by replacing the low 32 bits of
``value.val[0]`` with the contents of the ``ACCDATA_EL1`` system
register. The returned value is the same as for ``__arm_st64bv``.

Custom Datapath Extension
#########################

The specification for CDE is in ``BETA`` state and may change or be extended
in the future.

The intrinsics in this section provide access to instructions in the
Custom Datapath Extension.

The ``<arm_cde.h>`` header should be included before using these
intrinsics.  The header is available when the ``__ARM_FEATURE_CDE`` feature
macro is defined.

The intrinsics are stateless and pure, meaning an implementation is permitted
to discard an invocation of an intrinsic whose result is unused without
considering side-effects.

CDE intrinsics
==============

The following intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_CDE`` is defined.
These intrinsics use the ``coproc`` and ``imm`` compile-time constants to
generate the corresponding CDE instructions.
The ``coproc`` argument indicates the CDE coprocessor to use.  The range of
available coprocessors is indicated by the bitmap ``__ARM_FEATURE_CDE_COPROC``,
described in ssec-CDE_.
The ``imm`` argument must fit within the immediate range of the corresponding CDE
instruction.  Values for these arguments outside these ranges must be rejected.

::

  uint32_t __arm_cx1(int coproc, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_cx1a(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_cx2(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_cx2a(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_cx3(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_cx3a(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);

  uint64_t __arm_cx1d(int coproc, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_cx1da(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_cx2d(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_cx2da(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_cx3d(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_cx3da(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);

The following intrinsics are also available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_CDE`` is defined,
providing access to the CDE instructions that read and write the
floating-point registers:

::

  uint32_t __arm_vcx1_u32(int coproc, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_vcx1a_u32(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_vcx2_u32(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_vcx2a_u32(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_vcx3_u32(int coproc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint32_t __arm_vcx3a_u32(int coproc, uint32_t acc, uint32_t n, uint32_t m, uint32_t imm);

In addition, the following intrinsics can be used to generate the D-register forms
of the instructions:

::

  uint64_t __arm_vcx1d_u64(int coproc, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_vcx1da_u64(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_vcx2d_u64(int coproc, uint64_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_vcx2da_u64(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint64_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_vcx3d_u64(int coproc, uint64_t n, uint64_t m, uint32_t imm);
  uint64_t __arm_vcx3da_u64(int coproc, uint64_t acc, uint64_t n, uint64_t m, uint32_t imm);


The above intrinsics use the ``uint32_t`` and ``uint64_t`` types as general
container types.

The following intrinsics can be used to generate CDE instructions that use the
MVE Q registers.

::

  uint8x16_t __arm_vcx1q_u8 (int coproc, uint32_t imm);
  T __arm_vcx1qa(int coproc, T acc, uint32_t imm);
  T __arm_vcx2q(int coproc, T n, uint32_t imm);
  uint8x16_t __arm_vcx2q_u8(int coproc, T n, uint32_t imm);
  T __arm_vcx2qa(int coproc, T acc, U n, uint32_t imm);
  T __arm_vcx3q(int coproc, T n, U m, uint32_t imm);
  uint8x16_t __arm_vcx3q_u8(int coproc, T n, U m, uint32_t imm);
  T __arm_vcx3qa(int coproc, T acc, U n, V m, uint32_t imm);

  T __arm_vcx1q_m(int coproc, T inactive, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);
  T __arm_vcx2q_m(int coproc, T inactive, U n, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);
  T __arm_vcx3q_m(int coproc, T inactive, U n, V m, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);

  T __arm_vcx1qa_m(int coproc, T acc, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);
  T __arm_vcx2qa_m(int coproc, T acc, U n, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);
  T __arm_vcx3qa_m(int coproc, T acc, U n, V m, uint32_t imm, mve_pred16_t p);

These intrinsics are polymorphic in the ``T``, ``U`` and ``V`` types, which
must be of size 128 bits.
The ``__arm_vcx1q_u8``, ``__arm_vcx2q_u8`` and ``__arm_vcx3q_u8`` intrinsics
return a container vector of 16 bytes that can be reinterpreted to other
vector types as needed using the intrinsics below:

::

  uint16x8_t __arm_vreinterpretq_u16_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  int16x8_t __arm_vreinterpretq_s16_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  uint32x4_t __arm_vreinterpretq_u32_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  int32x4_t __arm_vreinterpretq_s32_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  uint64x2_t __arm_vreinterpretq_u64_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  int64x2_t __arm_vreinterpretq_s64_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  float16x8_t __arm_vreinterpretq_f16_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  float32x4_t __arm_vreinterpretq_f32_u8 (uint8x16_t in);
  float64x2_t __arm_vreinterpretq_f64_u8 (uint8x16_t in);

The parameter ``inactive`` can be set to an uninitialized (don't care) value
using the MVE ``vuninitializedq`` family of intrinsics.

Memory tagging intrinsics
##########################

The intrinsics in this section provide access to the
Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) introduced with the Armv8.5-A [ARMARMv85]_ architecture.

The ``<arm_acle.h>`` header should be included before using these intrinsics.

These intrinsics are expected to be used in system code, including freestanding
environments.  As such, implementations must guarantee that no new linking
dependencies to runtime support libraries will occur when these
intrinsics are used.

.. _ssec-MTE:

Memory tagging
==============

Memory tagging is a lightweight, probabilistic version of a lock and key
system where one of a limited set of lock values can be associated with
the memory locations forming part of an allocation, and the equivalent key
is stored in unused high bits of addresses used as references
to that allocation. On each use of a reference the key is checked to make
sure that it matches with the lock before an access is made.

When allocating memory, programmers must assign a lock to that section of memory.
When freeing an allocation, programmers must change the lock value so that
further referencing using the previous key has a reasonable probability of
failure.

The intrinsics specified below support creation, storage,
and retrieval of the lock values, leaving software to select and set the values
on allocation and deallocation. The intrinsics are expected to help protect
heap allocations.

The lock is referred in the text below as ``allocation tag`` and the key as
``logical address tag`` (or in short ``logical tag``).

.. _ssec-MTETerms:

Terms and implementation details
================================

The memory system is extended with a new physical address space containing
an allocation tag for each 16-byte granule of memory in the existing data
physical address space. All loads and stores to  memory must pass a
valid logical address tag as part of the reference. However, SP- and PC-relative
addresses are not checked. The logical tag is held in the upper bits of
the reference.  There are 16 available logical tags that can be used.

.. _ssec-MTEIntrinsics:

MTE intrinsics
==============

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_MEMORY_TAGGING`` is defined.
Type T below can be any type.
Where the function return type is specified as T, the return type is determined
from the input argument which must be also be specified as of type T.
If the input argument T has qualifiers ``const`` or  ``volatile``, the return
type T will also have the ``const`` or ``volatile`` qualifier.
::

   T* __arm_mte_create_random_tag(T* src, uint64_t mask);

This intrinsic returns a pointer containing a randomly created logical address tag.
The first argument is a pointer ``src`` containing  an address.
The second argument is a ``mask``, where the lower 16 bits specify logical tags
which must be excluded from consideration.
The intrinsic returns a pointer which is a copy of the input address but also
contains a randomly created logical tag (in the upper bits), that excludes any
logical tags specified by the ``mask``.
A ``mask`` of zero excludes no tags.
::

   T* __arm_mte_increment_tag(T* src, unsigned offset);

This intrinsic returns a pointer which is a copy of the input pointer ``src``
but with the logical address tag part offset by a specified offset value.
The first argument is a pointer ``src`` containing  an address and a logical tag.
The second argument is an offset which must be a compile time constant value
in the range [0,15].
The intrinsic adds ``offset`` to the logical tag part of ``src``
returning a pointer with the incremented logical tag.
If adding the offset increments the logical tag beyond the valid 16 tags,
the value is wrapped around.
::

  uint64_t __arm_mte_exclude_tag(T* src, uint64_t excluded);

This intrinsic adds a logical tag to the set of excluded logical tags.
The first argument is a pointer ``src`` containing  an address and a logical tag.
The second argument ``excluded`` is a mask where the lower 16 bits specify
logical tags which are in current excluded set.
The intrinsic adds the logical tag of ``src`` to the set specified by ``excluded``
and returns the new excluded tag set.
::

  void __arm_mte_set_tag(T* tag_address);

This intrinsic stores an allocation tag, computed from the logical tag,
to the tag memory thereby setting the allocation tag for the 16-byte
granule of memory.
The argument is a pointer ``tag_address`` containing  a logical tag and an address.
The address must be 16-byte aligned.
The type of the pointer is ignored (i.e. allocation tag is set only for a
single granule even if the pointer points  to a type that is greater than 16 bytes).
These intrinsics generate an unchecked access to memory.
::

  T* __arm_mte_get_tag(T* address);

This intrinsic loads the allocation tag from tag memory and returns the
corresponding logical tag as part of the returned pointer value.
The argument is a pointer ``address`` containing an address from which
allocation tag memory is read.
The pointer ``address``  need not be 16-byte aligned as it applies
to the 16-byte naturally aligned granule containing the un-aligned pointer.
The return value is a pointer whose address part comes from ``address``
and the logical tag value is the value computed from the allocation
tag that was read from tag memory.
::

  ptrdiff_t __arm_mte_ptrdiff(T* a, T* b);

The intrinsic calculates the difference between the address parts of the
two pointers, ignoring the tags.
The return value is the sign-extended result of the computation.
The tag bits in the input pointers are ignored for this operation.

System register access
######################

Special register intrinsics
===========================

Intrinsics are provided to read and write system and coprocessor
registers, collectively referred to as special register.
::

  uint32_t __arm_rsr(const char *special_register);

Reads a 32-bit system register.
::

  uint64_t __arm_rsr64(const char *special_register);

Reads a 64-bit system register.
::

  void* __arm_rsrp(const char *special_register);

Reads a system register containing an address.
::

  float __arm_rsrf(const char *special_register);

Reads a 32-bit coprocessor register containing a floating point value.
::

::

  void __arm_wsrf(const char *special_register, float value);

Writes a floating point value to a 32-bit coprocessor register.
::

  void __arm_wsrf64(const char *special_register, double value);

Writes a floating point value to a 64-bit coprocessor register.

Special register designations
=============================

The ``special_register`` parameter must be a compile time string literal.
This means that the implementation can determine the register being
accessed at compile-time and produce the correct instruction without
having to resort to self-modifying code. All register specifiers are
case-insensitive (so "apsr" is equivalent to "APSR"). The string literal
should have one of the forms described below.

AArch32 32-bit coprocessor register
-----------------------------------

When specifying a 32-bit coprocessor register to ``__arm_rsr``,
``__arm_rsrp``, ``__arm_rsrf``, ``__arm_wsr``, ``__arm_wsrp``, or
``__arm_wsrf``:

::

  cp<coprocessor>:<opc1>:c<CRn>:c<CRm>:<opc2>

Or (equivalently)::

  p<coprocessor>:<opc1>:c<CRn>:c<CRm>:<opc2>

Where:

 * ``<coprocessor>`` is a decimal integer in the range ``[0, 15]``
 * ``<opc1>``, ``<opc2>`` are decimal integers in the range ``[0, 7]``
 * ``<CRn>``, ``<CRm>`` are decimal integers in the range ``[0, 15]``.

The values of the register specifiers will be as described in [ARMARM]_
or the Technical Reference Manual (TRM) for the specific processor.

So to read MIDR:

::

  unsigned int midr = __arm_rsr("cp15:0:c0:c0:0");

ACLE does not specify predefined strings for the system coprocessor
register names documented in the Arm Architecture Reference Manual (for example |ldquo| MIDR |rdquo|).

AArch32 32-bit system register
------------------------------

When specifying a 32-bit system register to ``__arm_rsr``, ``__arm_rsrp``,
``__arm_wsr``, or ``__arm_wsrp``, one of:

 * The values accepted in the ``spec_reg`` field of the MRS
   instruction [ARMARM]_ (B6.1.5), for example CPSR.

 * The values accepted in the ``spec_reg`` field of the MSR
   (immediate) instruction [ARMARM]_ (B6.1.6).

 * The values accepted in the ``spec_reg`` field of the VMRS
   instruction [ARMARM]_ (B6.1.14), for example FPSID.

 * The values accepted in the ``spec_reg`` field of the VMSR
   instruction [ARMARM]_ (B6.1.15), for example FPSCR.

 * The values accepted in the ``spec_reg`` field of the MSR and MRS
   instructions with virtualization extensions [ARMARM]_ (B1.7), for example
   ``ELR_Hyp``.

   Armv7-M system instructions. [ARMv7M]_ (B5.1.1), for example PRIMASK.

AArch32 64-bit coprocessor register
-----------------------------------

When specifying a 64-bit coprocessor register to ``__arm_rsr64``,
``__arm_rsrf64``, ``__arm_wsr64``, or ``__arm_wsrf64``::

  cp<coprocessor>:<opc1>:c<CRm>

Or (equivalently)::

  p<coprocessor>:<opc1>:c<Rm>

Where:

 *  ``<coprocessor>`` is a decimal integer in the range ``[0, 15]``
 * ``<opc1>`` is a decimal integer in the range ``[0, 7]``
 * ``<CRm>`` is a decimal integer in the range ``[0, 15]``

AArch64 system register
-----------------------

When specifying a system register to ``__arm_rsr``, ``__arm_rsr64``,
``__arm_rsrp``, ``__arm_wsr``, ``__arm_wsr64`` or ``__arm_wsrp``:

::

  "o0:op1:CRn:CRm:op2"

Where:

 * ``<o0>`` is a decimal integer in the range ``[0, 1]``
 * ``<op1>``, ``<op2>`` are decimal integers in the range ``[0, 7]``
 * ``<CRm>``, ``<CRn>`` are decimal integers in the range ``[0, 15]``

AArch64 processor state field
-----------------------------

``__arm_wsr``, or ``__arm_wsrp``, one of the values accepted in the
pstatefield of the MSR (immediate) instruction [ARMARMv8]_ (C5.6.130).

Coprocessor Intrinsics
======================

AArch32 coprocessor intrinsics
------------------------------

In the intrinsics below ``coproc``, ``opc1``, ``opc2``, ``CRn`` and ``CRd`` are
all compile time integer constants with appropriate values as defined by the
coprocessor for the intended architecture.

The argument order for all intrinsics is the same as the operand order for the
instruction as described in the Arm Architecture Reference Manual, with the exception of ``MRC``/
``MRC2``/ ``MRRC``/``MRRC2`` which omit the Arm register arguments and instead
returns a value and ``MCRR``/``MCRR2`` which accepts a single 64 bit unsigned
integer instead of two 32-bit unsigned integers.

AArch32 Data-processing coprocessor intrinsics
----------------------------------------------

Intrinsics are provided to create coprocessor data-processing instructions as follows:

+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

AArch32 Integer to coprocessor transfer intrinsics
--------------------------------------------------

Intrinsics are provided to map to coprocessor to core register transfer instructions as follows:

+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| **Intrinsics**                                               | **Equivalent Instruction**            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|void __arm_mcr(coproc, opc1, uint32_t value, CRn, CRm, opc2)  | MCR coproc, opc1, Rt, CRn, CRm, opc2  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|void __arm_mcr2(coproc, opc1, uint32_t value, CRn, CRm, opc2) | MCR2 coproc, opc1, Rt, CRn, CRm, opc2 |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|uint32_t __arm_mrc(coproc, opc1, CRn, CRm, opc2)              | MRC coproc, opc1, Rt, CRn, CRm, opc2  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|uint32_t __arm_mrc2(coproc, opc1, CRn, CRm, opc2)             | MRC2 coproc, opc1, Rt, CRn, CRm, opc2 |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|void __arm_mcrr(coproc, opc1, uint64_t value, CRm)            | MCRR coproc, opc1, Rt, Rt2, CRm       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|void __arm_mcrr2(coproc, opc1, uint64_t value, CRm)           | MCRR2 coproc, opc1, Rt, Rt2, CRm      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|uint64_t __arm_mrrc(coproc, opc1, CRm)                        | MRRC coproc, opc1, Rt, Rt2, CRm       |

+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

The intrinsics ``__arm_mcrr``/``__arm_mcrr2`` accept a single unsigned 64-bit
integer value instead of two 32-bit integers.  The low half of the value goes
in register ``Rt`` and the high half goes in ``Rt2``.  Likewise for
``__arm_mrrc``/``__arm_mrrc2`` which return an unsigned 64-bit integer.

Unspecified behavior
====================

ACLE does not specify how the implementation should behave in the
following cases:

 * When merging multiple reads/writes of the same register.

 * When writing to a read-only register, or a register that is
   undefined on the architecture being compiled for.

 * When reading or writing to a register which the implementation
   models by some other means (this covers |--| but is not limited to |--|
   reading/writing cp10 and cp11 registers when VFP is enabled, and
   reading/writing the CPSR).

 * When reading or writing a register using one of these
   intrinsics with an inappropriate type for the value being read or
   written to.

 * When writing to a coprocessor register that carries out a
   "System operation".

 * When using a register specifier which doesn't apply to the
   targetted architecture.

Instruction generation
######################

Instruction generation, arranged by instruction
===============================================

The following table indicates how instructions may be generated by
intrinsics, and/or C code. The table includes integer data processing
and certain system instructions.

Compilers are encouraged to use opportunities to combine instructions,
or to use shifted/rotated operands where available. In general,
intrinsics are not provided for accumulating variants of instructions in
cases where the accumulation is a simple addition (or subtraction)
following the instruction.

The table indicates which architectures the instruction is supported on,
as follows:

Architecture 8 means Armv8-A AArch32 and AArch64, 8-32
means Armv8-AArch32 only.  8-64 means Armv8-AArch64 only.

Architecture 7 means Armv7-A and Armv7-R.

In the sequence of Arm architectures { 5, 5TE, 6, 6T2, 7 }
each architecture includes its predecessor instruction set.

In the sequence of Thumb-only architectures { 6-M, 7-M, 7E-M }
each architecture includes its predecessor instruction set.

7MP are the Armv7 architectures that implement the Multiprocessing Extensions.

Advanced SIMD (Neon) intrinsics
###############################

Introduction
============

The Advanced SIMD instructions provide packed Single Instruction
Multiple Data (SIMD) and single-element scalar operations on a range
of integer and floating-point types.

Neon is an implementation of the Advanced SIMD instructions which is
provided as an extension for some Cortex-A Series processors. Where this
document refers to Neon instructions, such instructions refer to the Advanced
SIMD instructions as described by the Arm Architecture Reference Manual
[ARMARMv8]_.

The Advanced SIMD extension provides for arithmetic, logical and saturated
arithmetic operations on 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit integers (and sometimes
on 64-bit integers) and on 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point data, arranged
in 64-bit and 128-bit vectors.

The intrinsics in this section provide C and C++ programmers with a
simple programming model allowing easy access to code-generation of the
Advanced SIMD instructions for both AArch64 and AArch32 execution states.

.. _ssec-NEON-intrinsics-concepts:

Concepts
--------

The Advanced SIMD instructions are designed to improve the performance of
multimedia and signal processing algorithms by operating on 64-bit or 128-bit
*vectors* of *elements* of the same *scalar* data type.

For example, ``uint16x4_t`` is a 64-bit vector type consisting of four
elements of the scalar ``uint16_t`` data type. Likewise, ``uint16x8_t`` is
a 128-bit vector type consisting of eight ``uint16_t`` elements.

In a vector programming model, operations are performed in parallel across
the elements of the vector. For example, ``vmul_u16(a, b)`` is a vector
intrinsic which takes two ``uint16x4_t`` vector arguments ``a`` and ``b``,
and returns the result of multiplying corresponding elements from each vector
together.


The Advanced SIMD extension also provides support for *vector-by-lane*
and *vector-by-scalar* operations. In these operations, a scalar value
is extracted from one element of a vector input, or provided directly,
duplicated to create a new vector with the same number of elements as an
input vector, and an operation is performed in parallel between
this new vector and other input vectors.

For example, ``vmul_lane_u16(a, b, 1)``, is a vector-by-lane intrinsic
which takes two ``uint16x4_t`` vector elements. From ``b``, element
``1`` is extracted, a new vector is formed which consists of four
copies of element ``1`` of ``b``, and this new vector is multiplied by
``a``.

*Reduction*, *cross-lane*, and *pairwise* vector operations work on pairs
of elements within a vector, or across the whole of a single vector
performing the same operation between elements of that vector. For example,
``vaddv_u16(a)`` is a reduction intrinsic which takes a ``uint16x4_t``
vector, adds each of the four ``uint16_t`` elements together, and returns
a ``uint16_t`` result containing the sum.

.. _ssec-vectypes:

Vector data types
-----------------

Vector data types are named as a lane type and a multiple. Lane type
names are based on the types defined in ``<stdint.h>``. For example,.
``int16x4_t`` is a vector of four ``int16_t`` values. The base types are
``int8_t``, ``uint8_t``, ``int16_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``int32_t``,
``uint32_t``, ``int64_t``, ``uint64_t``, ``float16_t``, ``float32_t``,
``poly8_t``, ``poly16_t``, ``poly64_t``, ``poly128_t``  and ``bfloat16_t`. The multiples are
such that the resulting vector types are 64-bit and 128-bit. In AArch64,
``float64_t`` is also a base type.

Not all types can be used in all operations. Generally, the operations
available on a type correspond to the operations available on the
corresponding scalar type.

ACLE does not define whether ``int64x1_t`` is the same type as ``int64_t``,
or whether ``uint64x1_t`` is the same type as ``uint64_t``, or whether
``poly64x1_t`` is the same as ``poly64_t`` for example for C++ overloading
purposes.

float16 types are only available when the ``__fp16`` type is defined, i.e.
when supported by the hardware.

bfloat types are only available when the ``__bf16`` type is defined, i.e.
when supported by the hardware. The bfloat types are all opaque types.  That is
to say they can only be used by intrinsics.

Advanced SIMD Scalar data types
-------------------------------

AArch64 supports Advanced SIMD scalar operations that work on standard
scalar data types viz. ``int8_t``, ``uint8_t``, ``int16_t``, ``uint16_t``,
``int32_t``, ``uint32_t``, ``int64_t``, ``uint64_t``, ``float32_t``,
``float64_t.``

Vector array data types
-----------------------

Array types are defined for multiples of 2, 3 or 4 of all the vector
types, for use in load and store operations, in table-lookup operations,
and as the result type of operations that return a pair of vectors. For
a vector type ``<type>_t`` the corresponding array type is
``<type>x<length>_t``. Concretely, an array type is a structure containing
a single array element called val.

For example an array of two ``int16x4_t`` types is ``int16x4x2_t``, and is
represented as::

  struct int16x4x2_t { int16x4_t val[2]; };

Note that this array of two 64-bit vector types is distinct from the
128-bit vector type ``int16x8_t``.

Scalar data types
-----------------

For consistency, ``<arm_neon.h>`` defines some additional scalar data types
to match the vector types.

``float32_t`` is defined as an alias for ``float``.

If the ``__fp16`` type is defined, ``float16_t`` is defined as an alias for
it.

If the ``__bf16`` type is defined, ``bfloat16_t`` is defined as an alias for it.

``poly8_t``, ``poly16_t``, ``poly64_t`` and ``poly128_t`` are defined as
unsigned integer types. It is unspecified whether these are the same type as
``uint8_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``uint64_t`` and ``uint128_t`` for overloading and
mangling purposes.

``float64_t`` is defined as an alias for ``double``.

.. _ssec-fp16-scalar:

16-bit floating-point arithmetic scalar intrinsics
--------------------------------------------------

The architecture extensions introduced by Armv8.2-A [ARMARMv82]_ provide a set
of data processing instructions which operate on 16-bit floating-point
quantities. These instructions are available in both AArch64 and AArch32
execution states, for both Advanced SIMD and scalar floating-point values.

ACLE defines two sets of intrinsics which correspond to these data
processing instructions; a set of scalar intrinsics, and a set of
vector intrinsics.

The intrinsics introduced in this section use the data types defined
by ACLE. In particular, scalar intrinsics use the ``float16_t`` type
defined by ACLE as an alias for the ``__fp16`` type, and vector intrinsics
use the ``float16x4_t`` and ``float16x8_t`` vector types.

Where the scalar 16-bit floating point intrinsics are available,
an implementation is required to ensure that including
``<arm_neon.h>`` has the effect of also including ``<arm_fp16.h>``.

To only enable support for the scalar 16-bit floating-point intrinsics,
the header ``<arm_fp16.h>`` may be included directly.

.. _ssec-bf16-scalar:

16-bit brain floating-point arithmetic scalar intrinsics
---------------------------------------------------------

The architecture extensions introduced by Armv8.6-A [Bfloat16]_ provide a set
of data processing instructions which operate on brain 16-bit floating-point
quantities. These instructions are available in both AArch64 and AArch32
execution states, for both Advanced SIMD and scalar floating-point values.

The brain 16-bit floating-point format (bfloat) differs from the older 16-bit
floating-point format (float16) in that the former has an 8-bit exponent similar
to a single-precision floating-point format but has a 7-bit fraction.

ACLE defines two sets of intrinsics which correspond to these data
processing instructions; a set of scalar intrinsics, and a set of
vector intrinsics.

The intrinsics introduced in this section use the data types defined
by ACLE. In particular, scalar intrinsics use the ``bfloat16_t`` type
defined by ACLE as an alias for the ``__bf16`` type, and vector intrinsics
use the ``bfloat16x4_t`` and ``bfloat16x8_t`` vector types.

Where the 16-bit brain floating point intrinsics are available,
an implementation is required to ensure that including
``<arm_neon.h>`` has the effect of also including ``<arm_bf16.h>``.

To only enable support for the 16-bit brain floating-point intrinsics,
the header ``<arm_bf16.h>`` may be included directly.

When ``__ARM_BF16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE`` is defined to `1` then these types are
storage only and cannot be used with anything other than ACLE intrinsics.  The
underlying type for them is ``uint16_t``.

Operations on data types
------------------------

ACLE does not define implicit conversion between different data types.
E.g.
::

  int32x4_t x;
  uint32x4_t y = x; // No representation change
  float32x4_t z = x; // Conversion of integer to floating type

Is not portable. Use the ``vreinterpret`` intrinsics to convert from one
vector type to another without changing representation, and use the ``vcvt``
intrinsics to convert between integer and floating types; for example:

::

  int32x4_t x;
  uint32x4_t y = vreinterpretq_u32_s32(x);
  float32x4_t z = vcvt_f32_s32(x);

ACLE does not define static construction of vector types. E.g.
::

  int32x4_t x = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

Is not portable. Use the ``vcreate`` or ``vdup`` intrinsics to construct values
from scalars.

In C++, ACLE does not define whether Advanced SIMD data types are POD types
or whether they can be inherited from.

Compatibility with other vector programming models
--------------------------------------------------

ACLE does not specify how the Advanced SIMD Intrinsics interoperate with
alternative vector programming models. Consequently, programmers should
take particular care when combining the Advanced SIMD Intrinsics
programming model with such programming models.

For example, the GCC vector extensions permit initialising a variable using
array syntax, as so ::

  #include "arm_neon.h"
  ...
  uint32x2_t x = {0, 1}; // GCC extension.
  uint32_t y = vget_lane_s32 (x, 0); // ACLE Neon Intrinsic.

But the definition of the GCC vector extensions is such that the value
stored in y will depend on both the target architecture (AArch32 or AArch64)
and whether the program is running in big- or little-endian mode.

It is recommended that Advanced SIMD Intrinsics be used consistently:

::

  #include "arm_neon.h"
  ...
  const int temp[2] = {0, 1};
  uint32x2_t x = vld1_s32 (temp);
  uint32_t y = vget_lane_s32 (x, 0);

Availability of Advanced SIMD intrinsics and Extensions
=======================================================

Availability of Advanced SIMD intrinsics
----------------------------------------

Advanced SIMD support is available if the ``__ARM_NEON`` macro is
predefined (see ssec-NEON_). In order to access the Advanced SIMD
intrinsics, it is necessary to include the ``<arm_neon.h>`` header. ::

  #if __ARM_NEON
  #include <arm_neon.h>
    /* Advanced SIMD intrinsics are now available to use.  */
  #endif

Some intrinsics are only available when compiling for the AArch64
execution state. This can be determined using the ``__ARM_64BIT_STATE``
predefined macro (see ssec-ATisa_).

Availability of 16-bit floating-point vector interchange types
--------------------------------------------------------------

When the 16-bit floating-point data type ``__fp16`` is available as an
interchange type for scalar values, it is also available in the vector
interchange types ``float16x4_t`` and ``float16x8_t``. When the vector
interchange types are available, conversion intrinsics between
vector of ``__fp16`` and vector of ``float`` types are provided.

This is indicated by the setting of bit 1 in ``__ARM_NEON_FP``
(see ssec-NEONfp_). ::

  #if __ARM_NEON_FP & 0x1
    /* 16-bit floating point vector types are available.  */
    float16x8_t storage;
  #endif
  
Availability of fused multiply-accumulate intrinsics
----------------------------------------------------

Whenever fused multiply-accumulate is available for scalar operations, it is
also available as a vector operation in the Advanced SIMD extension. When
a vector fused multiply-accumulate is available, intrinsics are defined to
access it.

This is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_FMA`` (see ssec-FMA_). ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_FMA
    /* Fused multiply-accumulate intrinsics are available.  */
    float32x4_t a, b, c;
    vfma_f32 (a, b, c);
  #endif

The Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81]_ architecture introduces two new instructions:
SQRDMLAH and SQRDMLSH. ACLE specifies vector and vector-by-lane intrinsics to
access these instructions where they are available in hardware.

This is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_QRDMX`` (see ssec-RDM_). ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_QRDMX
    /* Armv8.1-A RDMA extensions are available.  */
    int16x4_t a, b, c;
    vqrdmlah_s16 (a, b, c);
  #endif

-----------------------------------------------------------

Armv8.2-A [ARMARMv82]_ introduces new data processing instructions which
operate on 16-bit floating point data in the IEEE754-2008 [IEEE-FP]
format. ACLE specifies intrinsics which map to the vector forms of these
instructions where they are available in hardware.

This is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC``
(see ssec-fp16-arith_). ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_FP16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC
    float16x8_t a, b;
    vaddq_f16 (a, b);
  #endif

ACLE also specifies intrinsics which map to the scalar forms of these
instructions, see ssec-fp16-scalar_. Availability of the scalar
intrinsics is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC``. ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC
    float16_t a, b;
    vaddh_f16 (a, b);
  #endif

Availability of 16-bit brain floating-point arithmetic intrinsics
------------------------------------------------------------------

Armv8.2-A [ARMARMv82]_ introduces new data processing instructions which
operate on 16-bit brain floating point data as described in the Arm
Architecture Reference Manual. ACLE specifies intrinsics which map to the vector
forms of these instructions where they are available in hardware.

This is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_BF16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC``
(see ssec-BF16fmt_). ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_BF16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC
    float32x2_t res = {0};
    bfloat16x4_t a' = vld1_bf16 (a);
    bfloat16x4_t b' = vld1_bf16 (b);
    res = vdot_bf16 (res, a', b');
  #endif

ACLE also specifies intrinsics which map to the scalar forms of these
instructions, see ssec-bf16-scalar_. Availability of the scalar
intrinsics is indicated by ``__ARM_FEATURE_BF16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC``. ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_BF16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC
    bfloat16_t a;
    float32_t b = ..;
    a = b<convert> (b);
  #endif


Availability of Armv8.4-A Advanced SIMD intrinsics
--------------------------------------------------

New Crypto and FP16 Floating Point Multiplication Variant instructions in
Armv8.4-A:

 * New SHA512 crypto instructions (available if ``__ARM_FEATURE_SHA512``)

 * New FML[A|S] instructions (available if ``__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_FML``).

These instructions have been backported as optional instructions to Armv8.2-A
and Armv8.3-A.

.. _ssec-DotIns:

Availability of Dot Product intrinsics
--------------------------------------

The architecture extensions introduced by Armv8.2-A provide a set of dot product
instructions which operate on 8-bit sub-element quantities. These instructions
are available in both AArch64 and AArch32 execution states using
Advanced SIMD instructions. These intrinsics are available
when ``__ARM_FEATURE_DOTPROD`` is defined (see ssec-Dot_). ::

  #if __ARM_FEATURE_DOTPROD
    uint8x8_t a, b;

Availability of Armv8.5-A floating-point rounding intrinsics
------------------------------------------------------------

The architecture extensions introduced by Armv8.5-A provide a set of
floating-point rounding instructions that round a floating-point number to an
to a floating-point value that would be representable in a 32-bit or 64-bit
signed integer type.
NaNs, Infinities and Out-of-Range values are forced to the
Most Negative Integer representable in the target size, and an
Invalid Operation Floating-Point Exception is generated.
These instructions are available only in the AArch64 execution state.
The intrinsics for these are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_FRINT`` is defined.
The Advanced SIMD intrinsics are specified in the Arm Neon Intrinsics
Reference Architecture Specification [Neon]_.

.. _ssec-MatMulIns:

Availability of Armv8.6-A Integer Matrix Multiply intrinsics
------------------------------------------------------------

The architecture extensions introduced by Armv8.6-A provide a set of
integer matrix multiplication and mixed sign dot product instructions.
These instructions are optional from Armv8.2-A to Armv8.5-A.

These intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8`` is defined
(see ssec-MatMul_).

Specification of Advanced SIMD intrinsics
=========================================

The Advanced SIMD intrinsics are specified in the Arm Neon Intrinsics
Reference Architecture Specification [Neon]_.

The behavior of an intrinsic is specified to be equivalent to the
AArch64 instruction it is mapped to in [Neon]_.  Intrinsics are specified
as a mapping between their name, arguments and return values and the AArch64
instruction and assembler operands which they are equivalent to.

A compiler may make use of the as-if rule from C [C99]_ (5.1.2.3) to perform
optimizations which preserve the instruction semantics.

Undefined behavior
==================

Care should be taken by compiler implementers not to introduce the concept of
undefined behavior to the semantics of an intrinsic.  For example, the
``vabsd_s64`` intrinsic has well defined behaviour for all input values,
while the C99 ``llabs`` has undefined behaviour if the result would not
be representable in a ``long long`` type. It would thus be incorrect to
implement ``vabsd_s64`` as a wrapper function or macro around ``llabs``.

Alignment assertions
====================

The AArch32 Neon load and store instructions provide for alignment
assertions, which may speed up access to aligned data (and will fault
access to unaligned data).  The Advanced SIMD intrinsics do not directly
provide a means for asserting alignment.

M-profile Vector Extension (MVE) intrinsics
###########################################

The M-profile Vector Extension (MVE) [MVE-spec]_ instructions provide packed Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) and single-element scalar operations on a range
of integer and floating-point types.  MVE can also be referred to as Helium.

The M-profile Vector Extension provides for arithmetic, logical and saturated
arithmetic operations on 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit integers (and sometimes
on 64-bit integers) and on 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point data, arranged
in 128-bit vectors.

The intrinsics in this section provide C and C++ programmers with a
simple programming model allowing easy access to the code generation of the
MVE instructions for the Armv8.1-M Mainline architecture.

Concepts
========

The MVE instructions are designed to improve the performance of SIMD operations
by operating on 128-bit *vectors* of *elements* of the same *scalar* data type.

For example, ``uint16x8_t`` is a 128-bit vector type consisting of eight
elements of the scalar ``uint16_t`` data type. Likewise, ``uint8x16_t`` is
a 128-bit vector type consisting of sixteen ``uint8_t`` elements.

In a vector programming model, operations are performed in parallel across
the elements of the vector. For example, ``vmulq_u16(a, b)`` is a vector
intrinsic which takes two ``uint16x8_t`` vector arguments ``a`` and ``b``,
and returns the result of multiplying corresponding elements from each vector
together.

The M-profile Vector Extension also provides support for *vector-by-scalar*
operations. In these operations, a scalar value is provided directly,
duplicated to create a new vector with the same number of elements as an
input vector, and an operation is performed in parallel between
this new vector and other input vectors.

For example, ``vaddq_n_u16(a, s)``, is a vector-by-scalar intrinsic
which takes one ``uint16x8_t`` vector argument and one ``uint16_t`` scalar
argument. A new vector is formed which consists of eight copies of ``s``,
and this new vector is multiplied by ``a``.

*Reductions* work across the whole of a single vector performing the same
operation between elements of that vector. For example, ``vaddvq_u16(a)`` is a
reduction intrinsic which takes a ``uint16x8_t`` vector, adds each of the eight
``uint16_t`` elements together, and returns a ``uint32_t`` result containing
the sum.  Note the difference in return types between MVE's ``vaddvq_u16`` and
Advanced SIMD's implementation of the same name intrinsic, MVE returns the
``uint32_t`` type whereas Advanced SIMD returns the element type ``uint16_t``.

*Cross-lane* and *pairwise* vector operations work on pairs of elements within
a vector, sometimes performing the same operation like in the case of the
vector saturating doubling multiply subtract dual returning high half with
exchange ``vqdmlsdhxq_s8`` or sometimes a different one as is the case with the
vector complex addition intrinsic ``vcaddq_rot90_s8``.

Some intrinsics may only read part of the input vectors whereas others may only
write part of the results.  For example, the vector multiply long intrinsics,
depending on whether you use ``vmullbq_int_s32`` or ``vmulltq_int_s32``, will
read the even (bottom) or odd (top) elements of each ``int16x8_t`` input
vectors, multiply them and write to a double-width ``int32x4_t`` vector.
In contrast the vector shift right and narrow will read in a double-width input
vector and, depending on whether you pick the bottom or top variant, write to
the even or odd elements of the single-width result vector.  For example,
``vshrnbq_n_s16(a, b, 2)`` will take each eight elements of type ``int16_t`` of
argument ``b``, shift them right by two, narrow them to eight bits and write
them to the even elements of the ``int8x16_t`` result vector, where the odd
elements are picked from the equally typed ``int8x16_t`` argument ``a``.

*Predication*: the M-profile Vector Extension uses vector predication to allow
SIMD operations on selected lanes.  The MVE intrinsics expose vector predication
by providing predicated intrinsic variants for instructions that support it.
These intrinsics can be recognized by one of the four suffixes:
* ``_m`` (merging) which indicates that false-predicated lanes are not written
to and keep the same value as they had in the first argument of the intrinsic.
* ``_p`` (predicated) which indicates that false-predicated lanes are not used
in the SIMD operation. For example ``vaddvq_p_s8``, where the false-predicated
lanes are not added to the resulting sum.
* ``_z`` (zero) which indicates that false-predicated lanes are filled with
zeroes. These are only used for load instructions.
* ``_x`` (dont-care) which indicates that the false-predicated lanes have
undefined values. These are syntactic sugar for merge intrinsics with a
``vuninitializedq`` inactive parameter.

These predicated intrinsics can also be recognized by their last parameter
being of type ``mve_pred16_t``.  This is an alias for the ``uint16_t`` type.
Some predicated intrinsics may have a dedicated first parameter to specify the
value in the result vector for the false-predicated lanes; this argument will
be of the same type as the result type.  For example,
``v = veorq_m_s8(inactive, a, b, p)``, will write to each of the sixteen lanes
of the result vector ``v``, either the result of the exclusive or between the
corresponding lanes of vectors ``a`` and ``b``, or the corresponding lane of
vector ``inactive``, depending on whether that lane is true- or false-predicated
in ``p``.  The types of ``inactive``, ``a``, ``b`` and  ``v`` are all
``int8x16_t`` in this case and ``p`` has type ``mve_pred16_t``.

When calling a predicated intrinsic, the predicate mask value should
contain the same value in all bits corresponding to the same element
of an input or output vector. For example, an instruction operating on
32-bit vector elements should have a predicate mask in which each
block of 4 bits is either all 0 or all 1.

::

  mve_pred16_t mask8 = vcmpeqq_u8 (a, b);
  uint8x16_t r8  = vaddq_m_u8  (inactive, a, b, mask8); // OK
  uint16x8_t r16 = vaddq_m_u16 (inactive, c, d, mask8); // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
  mve_pred16_t mask8 = 0x5555;		  // Predicate every other byte.
  uint8x16_t r8  = vaddq_m_u8  (inactive, a, b, mask8); // OK
  uint16x8_t r16 = vaddq_m_u16 (inactive, c, d, mask8); // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR

In cases where the input and output vectors have different sizes (a
widening or narrowing operation), the mask should be consistent with
the largest element size used by the intrinsic. For example,
``vcvtbq_m_f16_f32`` and ``vcvtbq_m_f32_f16`` should *both* be passed
a predicate mask consistent with 32-bit vector lanes.

Users wishing to exploit the MVE architecture's predication behavior
in finer detail than this constraint permits are encouraged to use
inline assembly.

Scalar shift intrinsics
=======================

The M-profile Vector Extension (MVE) also provides a set of scalar shift
instructions that operate on signed and unsigned double-words and single-words.
These shifts can perform additional saturation, rounding, or both. The ACLE for
MVE defines intrinsics for these instructions.

Namespace
=========

By default all M-profile Vector Extension intrinsics are available with and
without the ``__arm_`` prefix.  If the ``__ARM_MVE_PRESERVE_USER_NAMESPACE``
macro is defined, the ``__arm_`` prefix is mandatory.  This is available to hide
the user-namespace-polluting variants of the intrinsics.

Intrinsic polymorphism
======================

The ACLE for the M-profile Vector Extension intrinsics was designed in such a
way that it supports a polymorphic implementation of most intrinsics.  The
polymorphic name of an intrinsic is indicated by leaving out the type suffix
enclosed in square brackets, for example the vector addition intrinsic
``vaddq[_s32]`` can be called using the function name ``vaddq``.  Note that the
polymorphism is only possible on input parameter types and intrinsics with the
same name must still have the same number of parameters.  This is expected to
aid implementation of the polymorphism using C11's ``_Generic`` selection.

.. _ssec-mve-vectypes:

Vector data types
=================

Vector data types are named as a lane type and a multiple. Lane type
names are based on the types defined in ``<stdint.h>``. For example,.
``int16x8_t`` is a vector of eight ``int16_t`` values. The base types are
``int8_t``, ``uint8_t``, ``int16_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``int32_t``,
``uint32_t``, ``int64_t``, ``uint64_t``, ``float16_t`` and ``float32_t``.
The multiples are such that the resulting vector types are 128-bit.

Vector array data types
=======================

Array types are defined for multiples of 2 and 4 of all the vector types, for
use in load and store operations. For a vector type ``<type>_t`` the
corresponding array type is ``<type>x<length>_t``. Concretely, an array type is
a structure containing a single array element called ``val``.

For example, an array of two ``int16x8_t`` types is ``int16x4x8_t``, and is
represented as::

  struct int16x8x2_t { int16x8_t val[2]; };

Scalar data types
=================

For consistency, ``<arm_mve.h>`` defines some additional scalar data types
to match the vector types.

``float32_t`` is defined as an alias for ``float``, ``float16_t`` is defined as
an alias for ``__fp16`` and ``mve_pred16_t`` is defined as an alias for
``uint16_t``.

Operations on data types
========================

ACLE does not define implicit conversion between different data types.
E.g.
::

  int32x4_t x;
  uint32x4_t y = x; // No representation change
  float32x4_t z = x; // Conversion of integer to floating type

Is not portable. Use the ``vreinterpretq`` intrinsics to convert from one
vector type to another without changing representation, and use the ``vcvtq``
intrinsics to convert between integer and floating types; for example:

::

  int32x4_t x;
  uint32x4_t y = vreinterpretq_u32_s32(x);
  float32x4_t z = vcvtq_f32_s32(x);

ACLE does not define static construction of vector types. E.g.
::

  int32x4_t x = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

Is not portable. Use the ``vcreateq`` or ``vdupq`` intrinsics to construct values
from scalars.

In C++, ACLE does not define whether MVE data types are POD types or whether
they can be inherited from.

Compatibility with other vector programming models
==================================================

ACLE does not specify how the MVE Intrinsics interoperate with alternative
vector programming models. Consequently, programmers should take particular
care when combining the MVE programming model with such programming models.

For example, the GCC vector extensions permit initialising a variable using
array syntax, as so ::

  #include "arm_mve.h"
  ...
  uint32x4_t x = {0, 1, 2, 3}; // GCC extension.
  uint32_t y = vgetq_lane_s32 (x, 0); // ACLE MVE Intrinsic.

But the definition of the GCC vector extensions is such that the value
stored in ``y`` will depend on whether the program is running in big- or
little-endian mode.

It is recommended that MVE Intrinsics be used consistently:

::

  #include "arm_mve.h"
  ...
  const int temp[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
  uint32x4_t x = vld1q_s32 (temp);
  uint32_t y = vgetq_lane_s32 (x, 0);


Availability of M-profile Vector Extension intrinsics
=====================================================

M-profile Vector Extension support is available if the ``__ARM_FEATURE_MVE``
macro has a value other than 0 (see ssec-MVE_).  The availability of the
MVE Floating Point data types and intrinsics are predicated on the value of
this macro having bit two set.  In order to access the MVE intrinsics, it is
necessary to include the ``<arm_mve.h>`` header. ::

  #if (__ARM_FEATURE_MVE & 3) == 3
  #include <arm_mve.h>
    /* MVE integer and floating point intrinsics are now available to use.  */
  #elif __ARM_FEATURE_MVE & 1
  #include <arm_mve.h>
    /* MVE integer intrinsics are now available to use.  */
  #endif

Specification of M-profile Vector Extension intrinsics
------------------------------------------------------

The M-profile Vector Extension intrinsics are specified in the Arm MVE
Intrinsics Reference Architecture Specification [MVE]_.

The behavior of an intrinsic is specified to be equivalent to the
MVE instruction it is mapped to in [MVE]_.  Intrinsics are specified
as a mapping between their name, arguments and return values and the MVE
instruction and assembler operands which they are equivalent to.

A compiler may make use of the as-if rule from C [C99]_ (5.1.2.3) to perform
optimizations which preserve the instruction semantics.

Undefined behavior
------------------

Care should be taken by compiler implementers not to introduce the concept of
undefined behavior to the semantics of an intrinsic.

Alignment assertions
--------------------

The MVE load and store instructions provide for alignment assertions, which may
speed up access to aligned data (and will fault access to unaligned data).  The
MVE intrinsics do not directly provide a means for asserting alignment.

Future directions
#################

Extensions under consideration
==============================

Procedure calls and the Q / GE bits
-----------------------------------

The Arm procedure call standard [AAPCS]_ says that the Q and GE bits are
undefined across public interfaces, but in practice it is desirable to
return saturation status from functions. There are at least two common
use cases:

To define small (inline) functions defined in terms of
expressions involving intrinsics, which provide abstractions or emulate
other intrinsic families; it is desirable for such functions to have the
same well-defined effects on the Q/GE bits as the corresponding
intrinsics.

DSP library functions
---------------------

Options being considered are to define an extension to the pcs
attribute to indicate that Q is meaningful on the return, and possibly
also to infer this in the case of functions marked as inline.

Returning a value in registers
------------------------------

As a type attribute this would allow things like::

  struct __attribute__((value_in_regs)) Point { int x[2]; };

This would indicate that the result registers should be used as if the
type had been passed as the first argument. The implementation should
not complain if the attribute is applied inappropriately (i.e. where
insufficient registers are available) it might be a template instance.

Custom calling conventions
--------------------------

Some interfaces may use calling conventions that depart from the AAPCS.
Examples include:

Using additional argument registers, for example passing an argument
in R5, R7, R12.

Using additional result registers, for example R0 and R1 for a
combined divide-and-remainder routine (note that some implementations
may be able to support this by means of a value in registers structure
return).

Returning results in the condition flags.

Preserving and possibly setting the Q (saturation) bit.

Traps: system calls, breakpoints, ...
-------------------------------------

This release of ACLE does not define how to invoke a SVC (supervisor
call), BKPT (breakpoint) and other related functionality.

One option would be to mark a function prototype with an attribute, for example
::

  int __attribute__((svc(0xAB))) system_call(int code, void const \*params);

When calling the function, arguments and results would be marshalled
according to the AAPCS, the only difference being that the call would be
invoked as a trap instruction rather than a branch-and-link.

One issue is that some calls may have non-standard calling conventions.
(For example, Arm Linux system calls expect the code number to be passed
in R7.)

Another issue is that the code may vary between A32 and T32 state.
This issue could be addressed by allowing two numeric parameters in the
attribute.

Mixed-endian data
-----------------

Extensions for accessing data in different endianness have been
considered. However, this is not an issue specific to the Arm
architecture, and it seems better to wait for a lead from language
standards.

Memory access with non-temporal hints
-------------------------------------

Supporting memory access with cacheability hints through language
extensions is being investigated. Eg.
::

   int *__attribute__((nontemporal)) p;

As a type attribute, will allow indirection of p with non-temporal
cacheability hint.

Features not considered for support
===================================

VFP vector mode
---------------

The short vector mode of the original VFP architecture is now
deprecated, and unsupported in recent implementations of the Arm
floating-point instructions set. There is no plan to support it through
C extensions.

Bit-banded memory access
------------------------

The bit-banded memory feature of certain Cortex-M cores is now regarded
as being outside the architecture, and there is no plan to standardize
its support.

Transactional Memory Extension (TME) intrinsics
################################################

Introduction
============
This section describes the intrinsics for the instructions of the
Transactional Memory Extension (TME). TME adds support for transactional
execution where transactions are started and
committed by a set of new instructions. The TME instructions are present
in the AArch64 execution state only.

TME is designed to improve performance in cases where larger system scaling
requires atomic and isolated access to data structures whose composition is
dynamic in nature and therefore not readily amenable to fine-grained locking
or lock-free approaches.

TME transactions are *isolated*. This means that transactional stores are
hidden from other observers, and transactional loads cannot see stores from
other observers until the transaction commits. Also, if the transaction fails
then stores to memory and writes to registers by the transaction are discarded
and the processor returns to the state it had when the transaction started.

TME transactions are *best-effort*. This means that the architecture does not
guarantee success for any transaction. The architecture requires that all
transactions specify a failure handler allowing the software to fallback to a
non-transactional alternative to provide guarantees of forward progress.

TME defines *flattened nesting* of transactions, where nested transactions are
subsumed by the outer transaction. This means that the effects of a nested
transaction do not become visible to other observers until the outer
transaction commits. When a nested transaction fails it causes the
outer transaction, and all nested transactions within, to fail.

The TME intrinsics are available when ``__ARM_FEATURE_TME`` is defined.

.. _ssec-TMEFailures:

Failure definitions
===================

Transactions can fail due to various causes. The following macros
are defined to help use or detect these causes.
::

  #define _TMFAILURE_REASON	0x00007fffu
  #define _TMFAILURE_RTRY	0x00008000u
  #define _TMFAILURE_CNCL	0x00010000u
  #define _TMFAILURE_MEM	0x00020000u

  #define _TMFAILURE_TRIVIAL	0x01000000u

Intrinsics
==========
::

  uint64_t __tstart (void);

Starts a new transaction. When the transaction starts successfully the return
value is 0. If the transaction fails, all state modifications are discarded
and a cause of the failure is encoded in the return value. The macros defined in ssec-TMEFailures_
can be used to detect the cause of the failure.
::

  void __tcommit (void);

Commits the current transaction. For a nested transaction, the only effect
is that the transactional nesting depth is decreased. For an outer transaction,
the state modifications performed transactionally are committed to the
architectural state.
::

  void __tcancel (/*constant*/ uint64_t);

Cancels the current transaction and discards all state modifications that
were performed transactionally. The intrinsic takes a 16-bit immediate input that encodes
the cancellation reason. This input could be given as

``__tcancel (_TMFAILURE_RTRY | (failure_reason & _TMFAILURE_REASON));``

if retry is true or

``__tcancel (failure_reason & _TMFAILURE_REASON);``

if retry is false.
::

  uint64_t __ttest (void);

Tests if executing inside a transaction. If no transaction is currently
executing, the return value is 0. Otherwise, this intrinsic returns the depth of the
transaction.
